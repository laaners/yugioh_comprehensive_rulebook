<h3>Specifically lists a card name/mentions a card name</h3>

<p>Taking example as "Dark Magician", effects that say "card that specifically lists/mentions the card "Dark Magician"" in the effects of cards like "Magician's Rod" means that the card name "Dark Magician" is listed in the effect text, excluding cards that only say "Dark Magician" in places outside the effect text section, like in their card name or illustration.</p>

<p>For the case of "The Eye of Timaeus" that does not specifically list a particular card name by saying "a "Dark Magician" Monster", it is not treated as a "card that specifically lists/mentions the card "Dark Magician", even if "Dark Magician" is placed in its effect text.</p>

<h4>Ritual Monsters whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card</h4>

<p>The text "A Ritual Monster whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card" means a Ritual Monster whose card name is written in the effect text of the corresponding Ritual Spell Card, like how "Black Luster Soldier" is written in the effect text of "Black Luster Ritual".</p>

<ul>
  <li>In cases in which a particular card name is not designated, like how ""Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monster" is written in the text of Super Soldier Ritual, this is not treated as "a Ritual Monster whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card".</li>
  <li>If the card names of 2 or more Ritual Monsters are written in the Ritual Spell Card chosen by "Pre-Preparation of Rites", 1 of them is added to the hand.</li>
  <li>If at the time of the resolution of the effect of "Pre-Preparation of Rites" it is not possible to add the chosen Ritual Spell Card and the corresponding Ritual Monster to the hand, neither can be added to the hand (the card has a "and" conjunctive).</li>
</ul>
