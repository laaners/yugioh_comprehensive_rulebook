<h3>Gains this effect</h3>

<h4>Normal monsters gain effect</h4>

<p>
  If a monster that is not an Effect Monster gains an effect by the effect of another card that says "gains this effect […]", that monster is treated as an Effect Monster.
  <br />
  Example: Since a "Gem-Knight Pearl" Xyz Summoned by using "Gagaga Head" and "Gagaga Magician" as Xyz Materials gains the effect that says "● If it is Xyz Summoned: Draw 1 card." by the effect of "Gagaga Head", it is treated as an Effect Monster.
