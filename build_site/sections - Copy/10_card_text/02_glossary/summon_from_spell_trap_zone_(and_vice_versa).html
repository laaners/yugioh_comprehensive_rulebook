<h3>Summon from Spell/Trap Zone (and vice versa)</h3>
<p>
  If an effect (1) targets a Monster Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone ((1) is not treated as a monster), if another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone, then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) resolves without effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Similary, if (1) targets (2) while in a Monster Zone but (2) is placed in the Spell/Trap Zone, (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) resolves without effect<sup><a href="#summon_from_spell_trap_zone-2">[2]</a></sup
  >.
