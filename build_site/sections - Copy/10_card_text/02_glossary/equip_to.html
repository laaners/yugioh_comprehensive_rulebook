<h3>Equip to</h3>
<p>In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards</li>
  <li>Equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term "Equip Card" includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters).</p>

<h4>Equipped Monster</h4>
<p>A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an "equipped monster." When this monster is destroyed or flipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</p>

<h4>Move equipped Monster Card to another target</h4>
<p>If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTION</strong>: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects.</p>
