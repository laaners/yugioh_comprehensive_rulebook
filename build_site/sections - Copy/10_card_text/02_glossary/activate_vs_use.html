<h3>Activate vs Use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cards that state "You can only activate this card once per turn/Duel" can be activated again in the same turn/Duel if their activation is negated.
    <ul>
      <li>For example: "Silver's Cry" (which can only be activated once per turn) and "The Seal of Orichalcos" (which can only be activated once per Duel) can be activated again during the same turn or Duel if another copy had its activation negated (such as by "Magic Jammer"), but not if only its effect was negated (such as by "Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy").</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that state "You can only use this effect once per turn/Duel" cannot be activated again in the same turn/Duel, even if their activation is negated.
    <ul>
      <li>For example: "Souleating Oviraptor" can only use each of its effects once per turn, while "Dotscaper" can only use each of its effects once per Duel, even if these monsters' effects are negated by a card such as "Solemn Strike".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
