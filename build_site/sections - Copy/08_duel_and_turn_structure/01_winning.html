<h2>Winning a Duel</h2>
<p>Each player starts a Duel with 8000 LP (Life Points). You win a Duel if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You reduce your opponent's LP to 0</li>
  <li>
    If your opponent is unable to draw a card.<br />
    Even if an effect that makes the player add cards from the Deck to the hand, or send cards from the Deck to the Graveyard, or something similar is activated when there are no cards left in the Deck, this only causes the effect to become unable to resolve but the player is not defeated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>If a card's special effect says you win (alternate victory conditions)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Victory conditions and immediately-afters</h3>
<p>Alternate victory conditions are checked and met before a new chain starts, even if a mandatory trigger effect has to start a chain.</p>

<h3>Draws</h3>
<p>
  If you and your opponent both reach 0 LP at the same time, or if both players resolve a single effect that makes them draw when neither player has cards in the Deck<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >, the Duel is declared a draw.
