  <p class="space-left-4">These cards give an extra effect to 1 face-up monster of your choice (either your own or your opponent's, depending on the card). They remain on the field after they are activated. The Equip Spell Card affects only 1 monster (called the equipped monster), but still occupies one of your Spell &amp; Trap Zones. If the equipped monster is destroyed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field, its Equip Cards are destroyed.</p>
