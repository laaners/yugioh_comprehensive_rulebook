  <p class="space-left-4">These cards go in your Field Zone and stay there. Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard. These cards may be placed facedown in the Field Zone, but are not active until flipped face-up.</p>
