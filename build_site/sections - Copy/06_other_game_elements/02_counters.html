<h2>Counters</h2>
<p>You may need to place these on cards for some card effects.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You cannot place counters unless a card effect allows it.</li>
  <li>Cards may have effects that change with the number of counters on them, or require you to remove counters as a cost.</li>
  <li>Some counters have specific names, such as "Spell Counter" or "Clock Counter." Other than their names, each individual counter itself does not have any effects.</li>
</ul>
