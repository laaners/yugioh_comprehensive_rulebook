<h2>Monster Tokens</h2>
<p>Monster Tokens are monsters that appear on the field as the result of a card's effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are not included in the Deck, and cannot be sent anywhere other than the field, such as the hand or Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are simply removed from the field instead.</li>
  <li>Each Monster Token takes up 1 of your 5 Monster Zones.</li>
  <li>Their battle position is always either face-up Attack Position or faceup Defense Position.</li>
  <li>Tokens cannot be used as an Xyz Material.</li>
  <li>Tokens on the field are treated as Normal Monsters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Banishing a token is a conjunction success</h3>
<p>If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).</p>
