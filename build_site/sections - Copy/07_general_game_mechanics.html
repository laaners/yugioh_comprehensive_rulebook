<h1>General Game Mechanics</h1>

<h2>Forbidden &amp; Limited Cards</h2>
<p>Normally, your Deck (including Extra Deck and Side Deck) can contain up to 3 copies of a card that has the same name. However, certain cards have specific quantity restrictions that further limit the number that can be included in a Deck. There are 3 types of restrictions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limited cards are restricted to 1 copy in a Deck</li>
  <li>Semi-Limited cards are restricted to 2 copies in a Deck</li>
  <li>Forbidden cards are not allowed to be included at all</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of Forbidden and Limited cards is updated regularly and is posted on the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Official Website. This list is applied to official tournaments so please check it before participating. Official Website: www.yugioh-card.com</p>

<h2>Public Knowledge</h2>
<p>The number of cards in a player's hand and Decks, the cards in their Graveyards, and each player's current LP are all public knowledge and both players can verify these things at any time. <strong>If asked, you must answer these things to your opponent truthfully</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are allowed to pick up and verify the cards in your opponent's Graveyard but you must ask their permission first.</li>
  <li>You may not change the order of the cards when verifying their Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules vs. Card Effects</h2>
<p>If there is a discrepancy between the basic rules and a card's effect, the card effect takes precedence. For example, a monster can only attack once per turn, but with a card effect, it is possible to attack twice.</p>
