<strong>1. Card Name</strong>
<p>Remember, cards with the same name are considered to be the same card, and you can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Main Deck and Side Deck combined.</p>

<strong>2. Type</strong>
<p>Instead of having an Attribute symbol like Monster Cards, a Spell Card has the "SPELL 魔" symbol and a Trap Card has the "TRAP 罠" symbol.</p>

<strong>3. Icon</strong>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/spell_trap_icons.png" alt="spell_trap_icons" width="360" />
</div>

<p>There are 6 types of icons that represent special properties a Spell or Trap Card may have. Spell and Trap Cards without an icon are called Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards.</p>

<strong>4. Card Description</strong>
<p>Each card's activation conditions and effects are provided here.</p>

<strong>5. Card Number</strong>
<p>A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>

<p>Spell Cards can normally be activated only during your Main Phase, and help you out with different effects. Spell Cards have many powerful effects, like destroying other cards or strengthening monsters. Save these cards in your hand until you can get the best results out of them.</p>
