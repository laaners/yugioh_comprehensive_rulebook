  <p class="space-left-4">These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require a cost to activate them.</p>
