<h2>Special Summon</h2>
<p>Some monsters can be played onto the field without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Link Summons, Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have specific conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise specified, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the field in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position.</p>

<h4>Immediately after this effect resolves ... Summon</h4>
<p>If an effect that Summon states "Immediately after this effect resolves", it instructs a player to perform a Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link Summon at the <strong>resolution</strong> of the Chain Link.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A monster summoned by such effects is <strong>not</strong> considered to have been "Special Summoned by an activated Monster/Spell/Trap effect"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>effect or the activation</strong> can be negated by cards that are able to negate "effects that include an effect that Special Summons a monster(s)"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>Summon</strong> of that monster(s) can be negated if the effect resolves as Chain Link 1<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Properly Special Summon</h3>
<p>
  This is different from "Special Summon Monsters." You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >, Spell/Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
  unless it was properly Special Summoned first. For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned first, before they can be Special Summoned by another card's effect.

<h4>Flip Summon and Properly Special Summon</h4>
<p>A monster (1) properly Special Summoned is on the field. If (1) is being flipped face-down by a card effect and then (1) is Flip Summoned, if a card effect negates (1)'s Flip Summon, (1) is still being treated as properly Special Summoned.</p>

<h2>Summon restrictions</h2>
<h3>Summon restrictions and successful Summons</h3>
<p>The restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon the turn you activate this card" only refers to monsters that were successfully Summoned. Same for "you can only Special Summon X once per turn" restrictions.</p>

<h3>Summon restrictions and properties changing</h3>
<p>A card (1) with the restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon except [...] monsters the turn you activate this card" applies its restrictions for the entire duration of the turn. Normally, if you Summon a monster (2) which violates the restriction of (1), then (1) cannot be activated. Similarly, if you activate (1) first (2) cannot be Summoned. But if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), then (1) can be activated <strong>after</strong> (2) has been Summoned.</li>
  <li>A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), but you activate (1) <strong>before</strong> (2) is Summoned, then (2) cannot be Summoned anymore.</li>
</ul>
