<h1>Trap cards</h1>
<p>Trap Cards will help you out with different effects, just like Spell Cards. The big difference between them is that you can activate Trap Cards during your opponent's turn. Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you can activate it at any time after that-starting from the beginning of the next turn.</p>
<p>Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the field like Trap Cards. However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent's turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase. You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the field to bluff your opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.</p>
