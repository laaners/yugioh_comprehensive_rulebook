        An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities. The effects of these monsters are split into four categories:
        <ol>
          <li>Continuous Effect</li>
          <li>Ignition Effect</li>
          <li>Quick Effect</li>
          <li>Trigger Effect (including Flip)</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Continuous Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Ignition Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Quick Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These are special monster effects that you can activate even during your opponent's turn. These types of effects have a Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell Speed of 1.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "When an effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can target 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Trigger Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These effects are activated at specific times, such as "during the Standby Phase" or "when this monster is destroyed".
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: Target 1 card on the field; destroy that target."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Flip Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word "FLIP:" on the card.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "FLIP: Draw 1 card."
      </td>
    </tr>
