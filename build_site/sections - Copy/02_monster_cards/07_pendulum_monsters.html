        Pendulum Monster Cards are a unique kind of card that blurs the line between Monsters and Spells! They can be Summoned as monsters to attack or defend, or you can activate them as Spell Cards in your Pendulum Zones to activate extra special abilities and allow you to Pendulum Summon!

        <br />
        Whenever one of your Pendulum Monster Cards on the field (regardless of which Zone it is in, or even if it is a monster or not) would be sent to the Graveyard, place it face-up on your Extra Deck instead. You can Pendulum Summon it back to the field later! Monsters Pendulum Summoned from the Extra Deck must be Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone or your Main Monster Zone pointed to by a Link Monster.
        <br /><br />
        Pendulum Monsters that have Monster Effects are Effect Monsters, and Pendulum Monsters that do not have Monster Effects written in their Monster Information are Normal Monsters. Even if Pendulum Monsters that do not have a Monster Effect have a Pendulum Effect, they are treated as Normal Monsters<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

        <b>How to Pendulum Summon</b>
        <ol>
          <li>During your Main Phase, activate Pendulum Monster Cards as Spell Cards in your leftmost and rightmost Spell &amp; Trap Zones. These Spell &amp; Trap Zones also become Pendulum Zones.</li>
          <li>After you have one in each Pendulum Zone, once per turn during your Main Phase, declare that you're Pendulum Summoning.</li>
          <li>Check the Pendulum Scales on the sides of your 2 Pendulum Monster Cards, then Special Summon as many monsters as you want from your hand and as many faceup Pendulum Monsters from your Extra Deck, whose Levels are in between those Pendulum Scales.</li>

<h3>Negate activation</h3>

<p>If Pendulum Monsters are placed in the Pendulum Zone, this is treated as the activation of a Spell Card. If their activation is negated by the effect of a card that negates the activation of Spells, since they are not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard, they are sent to the Graveyard like any other card</p>

<h3>Outside the field and negate summons</h3>

<p>Pendulum Monsters sent from outside the field to the Graveyard are sent to the Graveyard normally. For example, f at the time you would Normal Summon a Pendulum Monster from the hand that itself is negated by "Solemn Judgment", the Pendulum Monster that is not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard is not added to the Extra Deck, and is sent to the Graveyard.</p>

<h3>Banish instead of sending to the Graveyard</h3>

<p>If an effect that says "Any monster sent to the Graveyard is banished instead." is being applied when a Pendulum Monster placed in the Pendulum Zone is destroyed, since it exists on the field as a Spell Card, it is not banished and it is added to the Extra Deck</p>

<p>If an effect like "Macro Cosmos" is being applied, so that (all kinds of) cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, the effect text takes precedence and Pendulum Monsters are not added to the Extra Deck and are banished instead.</p>
