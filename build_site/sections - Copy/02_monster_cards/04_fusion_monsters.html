        Fusion Monsters placed in your Extra Deck (not in your Main Deck). They are Summoned by using the specific monsters listed on the card (called Fusion Materials) combined with a Summoning card like "Polymerization".<br /><br />
        If a Fusion Monster on the field or Graveyard or a Fusion Monster Card that is banished would be returned to the hand or Deck by a card effect, that monster is returned to the ownerâ€™s Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>.

        <b>How to fusion Summon</b>
        <ol>
          <li>If you have all the Fusion Materials listed on the Fusion Monster Card, in the places specified on your Summoning card, you can activate your Summoning card by placing it in your Spell &amp; Trap Zone.</li>
          <li>Send the Fusion Materials to the Graveyard, then take the appropriate Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck and play it either in the Extra Monster Zone or in any of your Main Monster Zones of in either face-up Attack or Defense Position.</li>
          <li>Finally, place your Summoning card in the Graveyard. (If another card effect causes your Fusion Materials to be sent to a place other than the Graveyard when your Summoning card resolves, send them to that other place, but the Fusion Summon still happens anyway).</li>
