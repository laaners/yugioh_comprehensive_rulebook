        Synchro Monsters are placed in the Extra Deck, separate from the Main Deck. You can Special Summon a powerful Synchro Monster to the field in an instant just by using the Levels of your monsters. They can be Synchro Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 1 face-up "Tuner" monster and any number of face-up non-Tuner monsters from your field to the Graveyard, when the sum of all their Levels is exactly equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster.<br /><br />
        If a Synchro Monster on the field or Graveyard or a Synchro Monster Card that is banished would be returned to the hand or Deck by a card effect, that monster is returned to the ownerâ€™s Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

        <b>Tuner Monsters</b>
        <br />
        In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster, you need 1 Tuner (look for "Tuner" next to its Type). The Tuner monster and other face-up monsters you use for the Synchro Summon are called Synchro Materials. The sum of their Levels is the Level of Synchro Monster you can Summon.
