        Xyz Monsters (pronounced "ikseez") can be Xyz Summoned whenever you control monsters that are the same Level. Xyz Monsters start in your Extra Deck, not in your Main Deck, and wait for you to call them into action.

        <br />
        When an Xyz Monster tells you to "detach" a material, take one of the stacked Xyz Material cards beneath your Xyz Monster and put it in the Graveyard.
        <br /><br />
        If an Xyz Monster that is banished, on the field, or in the Graveyard would be returned to the hand or Deck by a card effect, that monster is returned to the ownerâ€™s Extra Deck instead<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.<br /><br />
        Xyz Monsters do not have a Level and have a Rank<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

        <ol>
          <li>Choose an Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck that you have the right Xyz Materials for. The Xyz Materials should be face-up on your field.</li>
          <li>During your Main Phase, declare that you are Xyz Summoning and stack the Xyz Materials on top of each other.</li>
          <li>Take the Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck and put it on top of the stacked Xyz Materials either in the Extra Monster Zone or in any of your Main Monster Zones in face-up Attack or Defense Position.</li>

<h3>Xyz Materials</h3>
<p>Monsters that are used to Xyz Summon are called "Xyz Materials", and are placed underneath the Xyz Monster, to show that they are attached to it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monsters that have become Xyz Materials are not treated as cards on the field.</li>
  <li>When an Xyz Monster leaves the field, all of the Xyz Materials attached to it are sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down, or becomes controlled by the opponent, the Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. They remain attached to the Xyz Monster.</li>
</ul>
