<strong>1. Card Name</strong>
<p>Remember, cards with the same name are considered to be the same card, and you can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Main Deck and Side Deck combined.</p>

<strong>2. Type</strong>
<p>Instead of having an Attribute symbol like Monster Cards, a Spell Card has the "SPELL 魔" symbol and a Trap Card has the "TRAP 罠" symbol.</p>

<strong>3. Icon</strong>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/spell_trap_icons.png" alt="spell_trap_icons" width="360" />
</div>

<p>There are 6 types of icons that represent special properties a Spell or Trap Card may have. Spell and Trap Cards without an icon are called Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards.</p>

<strong>4. Card Description</strong>
<p>Each card's activation conditions and effects are provided here.</p>

<strong>5. Card Number</strong>
<p>A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>

<p>Spell Cards can normally be activated only during your Main Phase, and help you out with different effects. Spell Cards have many powerful effects, like destroying other cards or strengthening monsters. Save these cards in your hand until you can get the best results out of them.</p>

<h2>Activating and Setting Spell Cards</h2>

<p>Activating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spell Cards other than Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated by the turn player during their Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect by placing them face-up.</li>
  <li>If a Spell Card is activated from the hand, it is placed face-up in 1 of the Spell & Trap Zones, with the exception of Field Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>If a set Spell Card is activated, it is changed from being face-down in a Spell & Trap Zone or Field Zone to being face-up.</li>
  <li>If there are no available zones in which to activate the Spell Card, it cannot be activated from the hand, with the exception of Field Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>Activating Spell Cards starts a chain. Spell Cards have a Spell Speed of 1, with the exception of Quick-Play Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>If a Spell Card is activated, cards that negate the activation of Spell Cards can be activated in a chain to that activation.</li>
  <li>Spell Cards that have their activations negated are sent to the Graveyard providing no particular effect is being applied. In that case, the Spell Card sent to the Graveyard is not treated as being sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard. The same applies if a set Field Spell Card has its activation negated.</li>
  <li>Activated Spells are treated as being face-up on the field.</li>
  <li>After resolving the effects of Spell Cards, they are sent to the Graveyard, with the exception of Continuous, Equip and Field Spells, as well as some Normal Spell Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="72302403">"Swords of Revealing Light"</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During their Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect, the turn player can place Spell Cards from the hand face-down.</li>
  <li>Placing a Spell card face-down from the hand is called Setting.</li>
  <li>If there are no available Zones in which to place the Spell Card, they cannot be Set, with the exception of Field Spells.</li>
  <li>Set Spell Cards can be activated even during that turn, with the exception of Quick-Play Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>The information of face-down Spell Cards, including whether they are a Spell Card or a Trap Card or not, is private to the opponent. However, face-down Field Spell Cards in the Field Zone are treated as Field Spell Cards. The controller of face-down Spell or Traps can always verify them.</li>
</ul>
