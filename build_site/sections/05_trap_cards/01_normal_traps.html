<h2>Normal Trap Cards</h2>
<p>Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you can activate it at any time after that - starting from the beginning of the next turn.</p>

<p>Normal Trap Cards have single-use effects and once their effects are resolved, they will be sent to the Graveyard, just like Normal Spell Cards. They are also similar to Normal Spell Cards because once activated, their effects are not likely to be stopped. However, your opponent can destroy your face-down Trap Cards on the turn they were Set, or before the time is right to activate them.</p>
