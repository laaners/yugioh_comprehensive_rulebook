    These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require a cost to activate them<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<ul>
  <li>
    Counter Traps are of Spell Speed 3. As a result, they can be activated in a chain to all cards and effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Counter Traps are activated on the timing when a monster is Normal/Flip/Special Summoned, cards are drawn, or when an attack is declared. Otherwise, they are activated in a chain to the activation of a card or effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Counter Traps that negate the activations of cards or effects must be activated in a chain to the activation of the card or effect that is to be negated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
