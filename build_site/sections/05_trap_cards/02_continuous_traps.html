  <p class="space-left-4">
    Just like Continuous Spell Cards, Continuous Trap Cards remain on the field once they are activated and their effects continue while they are face-up on the field. Some Continuous Trap Cards have abilities similar to the Ignition Effects or Trigger Effects that can be found on Effect Monster Cards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, Continuous Trap keep exerting their effects as long as they remain face-up in a Spell & Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are Continuous Traps that have effects that can activate under certain conditions after their activation. In that case, this is treated as activating an effect and not as activating a Trap Card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effects of face-up Continuous Traps that activate are of Spell Speed 2. As a result, they can be activated in a chain to the activation of cards or effects in most cases<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effects of Continuous Traps can be resolved when that card is activated, provided the conditions to activate it are met when the card is activated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9765723">"Dark Contract with the Witch"</span> is activated from being face-down, its effect that says "You can send 1 "D/D" or "Dark Contract" card from your hand to the Graveyard, then target 1 card on the field; destroy it." can be applied. Also, in most cases, when a card is activated from being face-down, only its activation can be performed.

    </details>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As an exception, there are effects that cannot be activated when the card is activated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
        <details>
          <summary>Example</summary>
          Since the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77783947">"Yang Zing Unleashed"</span> that says "During either player's Main Phase or Battle Phase: You can send this face-up card from your Spell & Trap Zone to the Graveyard; immediately after this effect resolves, Synchro Summon 1 Synchro Monster, using 1 or more "Yang Zing" monsters you control as Synchro Materials." needs to send <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77783947">"Yang Zing Unleashed"</span> itself to the Graveyard, it cannot be applied when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77783947">"Yang Zing Unleashed"</span> is activated. It must be activated in a new chain after the activation of the card is finished.
          <hr />
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        Continuous(-like) Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >.
        <details>
          <summary>Example</summary>
          You control a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>. If you control a non-"Infernoid" monster, you can active it. If you choose to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>'s effect that sends "Infernoid" monsters to the Graveyard as part of the card activation, before that effect begins resolving, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> will be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect. As a result, you will then be unable to send "Infernoid" monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard.
          <hr />
        </details>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects of Continuous Traps stop applying immediately when they leave the field. Also, if a Continuous Trap that has already been activated activates an effect, and that Continuous Trap is destroyed by a card effect activated in a chain, the effect of the Continuous Trap does not resolve<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
