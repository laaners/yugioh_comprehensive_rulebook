<h2>Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)</h2>
<p>
  Problem-Solving Card Text (often abbreviated PSCT) is a method of writing card text used for prints released from July 8, 2011 onward. The purpose of Problem-Solving Card Text is to specify card effects to the point that most situations can be resolved by logically interpreting the card text<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>Problem-Solving Card Text uses specific words with very particular meanings in the context of gameplay. How to interpret the text is important to understanding how to apply card text to the game.</p>

<p>This interpretation can only be applied for cards that use Problem-Solving Card Text. Cards that were printed with earlier text may use some of the same terms or structures, but this does not necessarily mean that they work as if they were Problem-Solving Card Text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    All card effects that make a Chain Link include a colon ":" or a semicolon ";" somewhere in their text (possibly both). If a card effect does not use either, it does not make a Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The activation of a Spell or Trap Card always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that resolves with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >. This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card's text.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>colon</strong> ":" describes <strong>activation conditions</strong> (limits on when or how often a card or effect can be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
    >). These conditions only need to be met when the card is activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conditions other than target requirements that have to be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a separate sentence after the effect sentence (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12538374">"Treeborn Frog"</span>)<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>semicolon</strong> ";" (but after the colon, if any) describes anything that happens when that card or effect is activated (such as <strong>costs and targeting</strong><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
    >).
  </li>
  <li>
    Built-In Special Summons (other than Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link) are denoted by parentheses "()" stating the location from which the monster can be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards with bulleted effects (‚óè) that resolve in the same Chain Link specify whether they resolve simultaneously or sequentially (if sequentially, effects are applied in the order they are listed). In these cases, each effect activated resolves independent of the success of the other(s).
    <ul>
      <li>The text "in sequence" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied sequentially (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25524823">"Gravekeeper's Oracle"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76224717">"Advance Zone"</span>).</li>
      <li>The text "(simultaneously)" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied simultaneously (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21502796">"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37390589">"Kunai with Chain"</span>).</li>
      <li>If neither is specified, the effects each make separate Chain Links (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36898537">"Metaphys Horus"</span>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Conjunctives</h3>
<p>
  The conjunctives "and", "and if you do", "also", and "then" have specific meanings<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>then</strong> do [B]", [B] happens after [A]. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. [A] is required for [B], but NOT vice versa: if [A] does not happen, then stop; even if [B] cannot happen, you still do [A]<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="28553439">"Magical Dimension"</span>, but <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5851097">"Vanity's Emptiness"</span> is activated in response, so that no Special Summons can be performed. What happens when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="28553439">"Magical Dimension"</span> resolves?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the proposed scenario, only the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="28553439">"Magical Dimension"</span> that tributes the targeted monster is applied.<br />(No Spellcaster monster is Special Summoned from the hand, and no monster on the field can be destroyed.)<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>

    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do [A] <strong>and</strong> [B]", both [A] and [B] happen simultaneously. BOTH [A] and [B] are required. If you cannot do both, you do nothing<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23998625">"Number 53: Heart-eartH"</span> says "When this card on the field is destroyed by a card effect while it has no Xyz Materials: You can Special Summon 1 <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97403510">"Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon"</span> from your Extra Deck and attach this card from the Graveyard to it as an Xyz Material." If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23998625">"Number 53: Heart-eartH"</span> was removed from the Graveyard with a Chained effect, you cannot Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97403510">"Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon"</span>.

  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>and if you do</strong>, do [B]", both [A] and [B] happen simultaneously. [A] is required for [B], but NOT vice versa: if [A] does not happen, then stop; even if [B] cannot happen, you still do [A]<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>also</strong> do [B]", both [A] and [B] happen simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>also, after that</strong>, do [B]", [B] happens after [A]. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur (This conjunctive was never discussed in the Problem-Solving Card Text articles, as it was not introduced until 2014)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>ATTENTION</strong>: in all cases, even if [B] is not required or neither is required for the other, both must [A] and [B] must still meet the activation requirements of the card or effect in order to activate that card or effect<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

    <u>Question:</u><br />If my opponent does not control any cards, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span>? Also, when resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span>, if my opponent does not control any cards, how does the effect resolve?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You cannot activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span> if your opponent controls no cards. When resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span>, if your opponent controls no cards, although you still return the targeted cards to your Deck, you do not apply the effect of returning your opponent's cards to the Deck.

  There is no conjunctive that indicates both parts of the effect are required while also indicating that the parts are not simultaneous. While this relationship is rare, it does occur for some effects - in particular, Fusion Summoning and Ritual Summoning effects, which normally text structures unique to that Summoning method, which do not use conjunctives at all for that part of their text. The card <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34834619">"Luminous Dragon Ritual"</span> uniquely indicates this relationship with the conjunctive "and" followed by "after that" at the end of the second part of the effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

<h4>Banishing a Token is a conjunction success</h4>
<p>
  If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74701381">"DNA Surgery"</span> is applying, and Dragon-Type is declared, can a Monster Token treated as Dragon-Type be banished by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20638610">"Dragon's Rebirth"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can target a Monster Token treated as Dragon-Type to banish with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20638610">"Dragon's Rebirth"</span>. Even in this case, the effect of Special Summoning a Dragon-Type monster from your hand or Graveyard is applied normally.
