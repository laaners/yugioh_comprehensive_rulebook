<h2>Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)</h2>
<p>
  Problem-Solving Card Text (often abbreviated PSCT) is a method of writing card text used for prints released from July 8, 2011 onward. The purpose of Problem-Solving Card Text is to specify card effects to the point that most situations can be resolved by logically interpreting the card text<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>Problem-Solving Card Text uses specific words with very particular meanings in the context of gameplay. How to interpret the text is important to understanding how to apply card text to the game.</p>

<p>This interpretation can only be applied for cards that use Problem-Solving Card Text. Cards that were printed with earlier text may use some of the same terms or structures, but this does not necessarily mean that they work as if they were Problem-Solving Card Text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    All card effects that make a Chain Link include a colon ":" or a semicolon ";" somewhere in their text (possibly both). If a card effect does not use either, it does not make a Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The activation of a Spell or Trap Card always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that resolves with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >. This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card's text.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>colon</strong> ":" describes <strong>activation conditions</strong> (limits on when or how often a card or effect can be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
    >). These conditions only need to be met when the card is activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conditions other than target requirements that have to be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a separate sentence after the effect sentence (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12538374">"Treeborn Frog"</span>)<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>semicolon</strong> ";" (but after the colon, if any) describes anything that happens when that card or effect is activated (such as <strong>costs and targeting</strong><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
    >).
  </li>
  <li>
    Built-In Special Summons (other than Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link) are denoted by parentheses "()" stating the location from which the monster can be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards with bulleted effects (‚óè) that resolve in the same Chain Link specify whether they resolve simultaneously or sequentially (if sequentially, effects are applied in the order they are listed). In these cases, each effect activated resolves independent of the success of the other(s).
    <ul>
      <li>The text "in sequence" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied sequentially (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25524823">"Gravekeeper's Oracle"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76224717">"Advance Zone"</span>).</li>
      <li>The text "(simultaneously)" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied simultaneously (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21502796">"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37390589">"Kunai with Chain"</span>).</li>
      <li>If neither is specified, the effects each make separate Chain Links (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36898537">"Metaphys Horus"</span>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
