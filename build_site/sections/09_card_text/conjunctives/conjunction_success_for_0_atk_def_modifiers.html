      <u>Question:</u><br />When an attack is declared involving my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25586143">"Predaplant Chimerafflesia"</span> and an opponent's monster with less than 1000 ATK, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25586143">"Predaplant Chimerafflesia"</span> that decreases the ATK of the opponent's battling monster by 1000 and increases its own by 1000?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Even when an attack is declared involving your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25586143">"Predaplant Chimerafflesia"</span> and an opponent's monster with less than 1000 ATK, you can activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25586143">"Predaplant Chimerafflesia"</span>. (You can even activate the effect if the opponent's monster has 0 ATK.) In that case, the effect will decrease the opponent's monster's ATK to 0, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25586143">"Predaplant Chimerafflesia"</span> gains 1000 ATK normally.
