<h2>Conjunctives</h2>
<p>
  The conjunctives "and", "and if you do", "also", and "then" have specific meanings<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>then</strong> do [B]", [B] happens after [A]. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. [A] is required for [B], but NOT vice versa: if [A] does not happen, then stop; even if [B] cannot happen, you still do [A]<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.

      <u>Question:</u><br />I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="28553439">"Magical Dimension"</span>, but <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5851097">"Vanity's Emptiness"</span> is activated in response, so that no Special Summons can be performed. What happens when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="28553439">"Magical Dimension"</span> resolves?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the proposed scenario, only the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="28553439">"Magical Dimension"</span> that tributes the targeted monster is applied.<br />(No Spellcaster monster is Special Summoned from the hand, and no monster on the field can be destroyed.)<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>

  <li>
    In "Do [A] <strong>and</strong> [B]", both [A] and [B] happen simultaneously. BOTH [A] and [B] are required. If you cannot do both, you do nothing<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23998625">"Number 53: Heart-eartH"</span> says "When this card on the field is destroyed by a card effect while it has no Xyz Materials: You can Special Summon 1 <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97403510">"Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon"</span> from your Extra Deck and attach this card from the Graveyard to it as an Xyz Material." If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23998625">"Number 53: Heart-eartH"</span> was removed from the Graveyard with a Chained effect, you cannot Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97403510">"Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon"</span>.

  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>and if you do</strong>, do [B]", both [A] and [B] happen simultaneously. [A] is required for [B], but NOT vice versa: if [A] does not happen, then stop; even if [B] cannot happen, you still do [A]<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>also</strong> do [B]", both [A] and [B] happen simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do [A], <strong>also, after that</strong>, do [B]", [B] happens after [A]. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur (This conjunctive was never discussed in the Problem-Solving Card Text articles, as it was not introduced until 2014)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>ATTENTION</strong>: in all cases, even if [B] is not required or neither is required for the other, both must [A] and [B] must still meet the activation requirements of the card or effect in order to activate that card or effect<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.

    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />If my opponent does not control any cards, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span>? Also, when resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span>, if my opponent does not control any cards, how does the effect resolve?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You cannot activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span> if your opponent controls no cards. When resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37164373">"Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"</span>, if your opponent controls no cards, although you still return the targeted cards to your Deck, you do not apply the effect of returning your opponent's cards to the Deck.

  There is no conjunctive that indicates both parts of the effect are required while also indicating that the parts are not simultaneous. While this relationship is rare, it does occur for some effects - in particular, Fusion Summoning and Ritual Summoning effects, which normally text structures unique to that Summoning method, which do not use conjunctives at all for that part of their text. The card <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34834619">"Luminous Dragon Ritual"</span> uniquely indicates this relationship with the conjunctive "and" followed by "after that" at the end of the second part of the effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
