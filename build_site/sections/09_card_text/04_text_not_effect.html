<h2>Text that is not an effect</h2>

<p>There are some parts of the Effect Text of cards that are not treated as an effect.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The text that is not an effect of a card is not negated if the effects of the card are negated.</strong></li>
  <li>
    The text that is not an effect is applied regardless of the circumstances in which the card is. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Since the text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85101097">"Putrid Pudding Body Buddies"</span> that says "Cannot be used as a Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz Material for a Summon." is not treated as an effect, a face-down <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85101097">"Putrid Pudding Body Buddies"</span> cannot be used as a Fusion Material either.</li>
      <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84565800">"Legendary Knight Hermos"</span> gains the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14309486">"Koa'ki Meiru Overload"</span>, the text that says "During each of your End Phases, destroy this card unless you send 1 "Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru" from your hand to the Graveyard or reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand." is not applied.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The following are examples of text that is not treated as an effect:
    <ul>
      <li>The requirements of Special Summon Monsters to Special Summon themselves.</li>
      <li>Text that says "otherwise, if you do not do either, destroy this card" or something similar in order to maintain that card (maintainance cost).</li>
      <li>Text that specifies the activation requirements for that effect like "the effect of [card name] can only be used once per turn".</li>
      <li>Text that specifies the type of Material that the card cannot be used as, like "cannot be used as a Synchro Material". Also, the text that designates the other Materials to be used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
