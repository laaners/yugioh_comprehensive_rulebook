<h2>Text that is not an effect</h2>

<p>There are some parts of the Effect Text of cards that are not treated as an effect.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The text that is not an effect of a card is not negated if the effects of the card are negated.</strong></li>
  <li>
    The text that is not an effect is applied regardless of the circumstances in which the card is. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Since the text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85101097">"Putrid Pudding Body Buddies"</span> that says "Cannot be used as a Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz Material for a Summon." is not treated as an effect, a face-down <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85101097">"Putrid Pudding Body Buddies"</span> cannot be used as a Fusion Material either.</li>
      <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84565800">"Legendary Knight Hermos"</span> gains the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14309486">"Koa'ki Meiru Overload"</span>, the text that says "During each of your End Phases, destroy this card unless you send 1 "Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru" from your hand to the Graveyard or reveal 1 Rock-Type monster in your hand." is not applied.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The following are examples of text that is not treated as an effect:
    <ul>
      <li>The requirements of Special Summon Monsters to Special Summon themselves.</li>
      <li>Text that says "otherwise, if you do not do either, destroy this card" or something similar in order to maintain that card (maintainance cost).</li>
      <li>Text that specifies the activation requirements for that effect like "the effect of [...] can only be used once per turn".</li>
      <li>Text that specifies the type of Material that the card cannot be used as, like "cannot be used as a Synchro Material". Also, the text that designates the other Materials to be used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Text that Specifies "Once per turn": Activate and Use</h3>
<p>
  Text that specifies the activation requirements for that effect, like "the effect of [...] can only be used once per turn", is text that is not an effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>Activate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If an activation is not negated, but later the effect is negated or is unable to resolve, the effect still counts as having been activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If "can only be activated once per turn" is written in a Spell or Trap Card, if the activation of that card is negated, another card with the same name can be activated again in the same turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If the activation of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98645731">"Pot of Duality"</span> is negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77414722">"Magic Jammer"</span>, if you have another copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98645731">"Pot of Duality"</span> in your hand, it can be activated again in the same turn.
  </li>
  <li>
    "the effect(s) of this card can only be activated once per turn" or simply "once per turn:" is written (different from "the effect of [card name] can only be activated/used once per turn"), if that card is flipped face-down or leaves the field and it later appears on the field face-up once again, the same effect of cards with the same name can be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        However, if control switches to the opponent, the effect cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If "can only be used once per turn" is written in a Monster Card, if the activation is negated, that effect cannot be activated again in the same turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If "can only be used once per turn" is written in a Spell or Trap Card that is already face-up, if that effect has its activation negated, it cannot be activated again during the same turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If "the effect of [card name] can only be used once per turn" is written with a particular card name, if that card leaves the field and returns to the field in the same turn, that card or cards with the same name cannot activate that effect in that turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The same applies if "can only be used once per Duel" is written<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, if control switches to the opponent, monsters with the same name that the opponent controls can activate that effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    For cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66413481">"Fire King Avatar Yaksha"</span> that say "You can only use this effect of "Fire King Avatar Yaksha" once per turn", the text that says "this effect" only refers to the previous effect. The other effects of that card can still be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

  For example, text that indicates that a monster cannot be a Synchro Material, or that indicates the Synchro Monster that can be Synchro Summoned using it, is text that is not an effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "Cannot be used as a Synchro Material" is text that indicates that the monster iself cannot be used as a Material<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. However, if the requirement also says "as long as this card is face-up" in cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="72714392">"Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor"</span>, that is a Continuous Effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    "If this card is used as a Synchro Material, the other monsters must be [...]" is text that indicates the other Synchro Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    "This card cannot be used as an Xyz Material for an Xyz Summon, except for the Xyz Summon of a DARK monster." is text that indicates the monster that would be Xyz Summoned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    "You can use monsters in your hand as non-Tuner Synchro Materials" is text that indicates the Synchro Materials in the hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  <li>
    Texts of this kind are not effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: you have just Tribute Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span>, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> is applying. You activate the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span> that returns a card to the hand. The text on <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span> that indicates that your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of that effect is not, itself, treated as a monster effect. Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> is applying to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span>, your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to you activating the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span> that returns a card to the hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Text does not grant this kind of protection to the card itself (so it does not say "this") <b>is</b> an effect. For example <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2347656">"Lovely Labrynth of the Silver Castle"</span>'s card text that says "Your opponent cannot activate monster effects in response to the activation of your Normal Trap Cards" is an effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
