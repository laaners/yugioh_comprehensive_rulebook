<h3>Trigger Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that are activated in a particular written timing are Trigger Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trigger Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects have a Spell Speed of 1. However, if multiple Trigger Effects activate at the same timing, they form a chain.</li>
  <li>Since multiple effects that activate during a particular phase like the Standby Phase or End Phase are not treated as activating simultaneously, after activating and resolving 1 effect, other Trigger Effects can be activated and resolved.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Trigger Effects do not activate if they meet their timing during the Damage Step. However, Trigger Effects that: activate mandatorily; activate when the monster itself is Special Summoned successfully; effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up; and effects that activate when the monster is destroyed, banished, or added to the hand, can be activated.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up activate in most cases when that monster is changed from being face-down to face-up on the field. When monsters with Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up are attacked and flipped face-up, the effects activate during the timing of "after damage calculation" of that battle.</li>
  <li>If a Trigger Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Activation Location</h4>
<p>
  If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, but hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", but its location (On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck) changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has been moved to a private location like the Deck or hand, the Trigger Effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> is activated discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> for the cost, and the same <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> is returned to the hand by the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> that says "add it to your hand.", the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> that activates "If this card is sent to the Graveyard:" does not activate.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Multiple Hand Summon Monster Triggers</h4>
<p>
  If you have multiple monsters in your hand with Trigger Effects to Special Summon themselves (that activate in the hand in a particular timing), their effects cannot be activated in a chain and only 1 of them can be activated.<br />
  Example: When you take battle damage while you have 2 copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span>, only the effect of 1 copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span> that says "When you take damage from a card in your opponent's possession:" can be activated.

<h4>Changing card type prevents Trigger effects from activating</h4>
<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has changed card type like from monster becomes an equip card, the Trigger Effect does not activate.
  <br />
  Example: when my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span> declares an attack, its effect is activated, and my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> in a chain by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span>. When resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span>, if I choose to equip the Special Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> to it, the Special Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> becomes an Equip Card, and is no longer a monster, so after the current chain resolves, its effect cannot be activated (in this case, after the chain resolves, since the number of monsters on your opponent's side of the field changed, a replay will occur).

<h4>Changing phase and Trigger still activating</h4>
<p>
  Trigger Effects still activate even when the phase changed during/after the resolution of an effect.
  <br />
  Example: you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> by Tributing it, and that effect resolves: it becomes the End Phase. Regardless, after <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span>'s effect resolves, a trigger effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50554729">"Amorphage Infection"</span> can be activated.

<h4>Spell/Trap Cards will not "see" trigger before the card activation has resolved</h4>
<p>
  Trigger effects of Spell/Trap Cards will not "see" their activation condition before the card activation has resolved.
  <br />
  Example: you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66399653">"Union Hangar"</span>, but then chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> and Special Summon a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65622692">"Y-Dragon Head"</span> from your Graveyard. In this scenario, although the LIGHT Machine-Type Union monster <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65622692">"Y-Dragon Head"</span> was Special Summoned, since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66399653">"Union Hangar"</span> had not resolved on the field yet, you cannot activate its second effect afterward.

</ol>

<h4>Changing control after their Trigger effect meets its activation condition, before that effect can be activated</h4>
<p>
  Monsters changing control after their Trigger effect meets its activation condition can activate their effects after they've changed control (in which case the player who took control of the monster activates it).
  <br />
  Example: you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span> in your Graveyard, banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> as a cost from your Graveyard and targeting your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span>. When resolving this effect, you gain control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> and you can activate the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> you gained control of due the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span>.

</ol>

<h4>Monsters with a certain property being Summoned, and then losing that property before Trigger effects are checked for</h4>
<p>Example: while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> is face-up on the field, Skill Drain is activated, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> resolves in response, Special Summoning Harpie Queen. At the time that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span>, its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". Afterwards, when the effect of Skill Drain applies, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is negated, and its name returns to being "Harpie Queen". Regardless, a "Harpie Lady" or "Harpie Lady Sisters" has been Special Summoned to the field, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> must be activated.</p>
