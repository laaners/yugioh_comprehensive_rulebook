<h3>Trigger Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that are activated in a particular written timing are Trigger Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trigger Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects have a Spell Speed of 1. However, if multiple Trigger Effects activate at the same timing, they form a chain.</li>
  <li>Since multiple effects that activate during a particular phase like the Standby Phase or End Phase are not treated as activating simultaneously, after activating and resolving 1 effect, other Trigger Effects can be activated and resolved.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Trigger Effects do not activate if they meet their timing during the Damage Step. However, Trigger Effects that: activate mandatorily; activate when the monster itself is Special Summoned successfully; effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up; and effects that activate when the monster is destroyed, banished, or added to the hand, can be activated.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up activate in most cases when that monster is changed from being face-down to face-up on the field. When monsters with Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up are attacked and flipped face-up, the effects activate during the timing of "after damage calculation" of that battle.</li>
  <li>If a Trigger Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Activation Location</h4>
<p>
  If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, but hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", but its location (On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck) changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has been moved to a private location like the Deck or hand, the Trigger Effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> is activated discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> for the cost, and the same <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> is returned to the hand by the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> that says "add it to your hand.", the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> that activates "If this card is sent to the Graveyard:" does not activate.

<h4>Multiple Hand Summon Monster Triggers</h4>
<p>
  If you have multiple monsters in your hand with Trigger Effects to Special Summon themselves (that activate in the hand in a particular timing), their effects cannot be activated in a chain and only 1 of them can be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    When you take battle damage while you have 2 copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span>, only the effect of 1 copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span> that says "When you take damage from a card in your opponent's possession:" can be activated.
    <hr />
  </details>
</p>

<p>
  Exception to this rule is when the hand summon triggers are mandatory effects: in which case they all activate and they form a chain<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    Two copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89310929">"Mist Valley Thunder Lord"</span> activate their effects in the same Chain, each targeting a different copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="69448290">"Mist Valley Thunderbird"</span> you control. After the described Chain has resolved, the respective Trigger effects of each copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="69448290">"Mist Valley Thunderbird"</span> will be activated as Chain Link 1 and Chain Link 2 respectively. Afterwards, your opponent will have the first opportunity to activate Chain Link 3.

<h4>Changing card type prevents Trigger effects from activating</h4>
<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has changed card type like from monster becomes an equip card, the Trigger Effect does not activate.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    When my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span> declares an attack, its effect is activated, and my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> in a chain by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span>. When resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span>, if I choose to equip the Special Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> to it, the Special Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> becomes an Equip Card, and is no longer a monster, so after the current chain resolves, its effect cannot be activated (in this case, after the chain resolves, since the number of monsters on your opponent's side of the field changed, a replay will occur).

<h4>Changing phase and Trigger still activating</h4>
<p>
  Trigger Effects still activate even when the phase changed during/after the resolution of an effect.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    You activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> by Tributing it, and that effect resolves: it becomes the End Phase. Regardless, after <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span>'s effect resolves, a trigger effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50554729">"Amorphage Infection"</span> can be activated.

<h4>Spell/Trap Cards will not "see" trigger before the card activation has resolved</h4>
<p>
  Trigger effects of Spell/Trap Cards will not "see" their activation condition before the card activation has resolved<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66399653">"Union Hangar"</span>, but then chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> and Special Summon a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65622692">"Y-Dragon Head"</span> from your Graveyard. In this scenario, although the LIGHT Machine-Type Union monster <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65622692">"Y-Dragon Head"</span> was Special Summoned, since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66399653">"Union Hangar"</span> had not resolved on the field yet, you cannot activate its second effect afterward<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you use <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89208725">"Metaverse"</span> to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33407125">"Labrynth Labyrinth"</span>, you cannot then activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33407125">"Labrynth Labyrinth"</span>'s effect that Special Summons a Fiend monster
    <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Changing control and trigger effects</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Monsters changing control after their Trigger effect meets its activation condition can activate their effects after they've changed control (in which case the player who took control of the monster activates it)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span> in your Graveyard, banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> as a cost from your Graveyard and targeting your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span>. When resolving this effect, you gain control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> and you can activate the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> you gained control of due the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span>.

    You activate a card (1) that takes control of an opponent monster as Chain Link 1. (1) does not target. Your opponent activates as Chain Link 2 an effect that summons a monster (2). The chain resolves backwards, (2) is special summoned first, then with (1) you take control of an opponent's monster. If you take control of (2), after the chain has finished resolving, you are (2)'s controller. Therefore, if (2)'s has a Trigger effect on summon, you can activate its effect at this time<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You activate the "take control of 1 monster your opponent controls until the End Phase" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25311006">"Triple Tactics Talent"</span>, and your opponent activated the "immediately after this effect resolves, Link Summon 1 Link Monster using materials you control, including this card" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65741786">"I:P Masquerena"</span> in response. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> is Link Summoned immediately after the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65741786">"I:P Masquerena"</span> resolves, and You gain control of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> when resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25311006">"Triple Tactics Talent"</span>. After the chain has finished resolving (at the time when the Trigger Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> can be activated), you are <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span>'s controller. Therefore, you can activate its effect at this time.

<h4>Monsters with a certain property being Summoned, and then losing that property before Trigger effects are checked for</h4>
<p>Example: while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> is face-up on the field, Skill Drain is activated, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> resolves in response, Special Summoning Harpie Queen. At the time that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span>, its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". Afterwards, when the effect of Skill Drain applies, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is negated, and its name returns to being "Harpie Queen". Regardless, a "Harpie Lady" or "Harpie Lady Sisters" has been Special Summoned to the field, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> must be activated.</p>

<h4>Events are not responded to until the chain has resolved</h4>
<p>
  Events are not responded to until the chain has resolved.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    Your opponent activates the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18094166">"Vision HERO Faris"</span> that Special Summons it from the hand, by discarding a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27780618">"Vision HERO Vyon"</span> from their hand. You have <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> set on your field. In this scenario, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> cannot be activated by chaining to that card effect. After that activated effect resolves, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> can be activated in a new Chain. Therefore, in this situation, when your opponent activates the second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18094166">"Vision HERO Faris"</span> that places a "Vision HERO" monster from their Deck face-up in their Spell & Trap Zone, you can chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> (if your opponent does not activate the second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18094166">"Vision HERO Faris"</span>, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> as Chain Link 1).

<h4>Discarding for hand size for a second time, and Trigger effects</h4>
<p>
  If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    At the end of your End Phase, you have 7 cards in your hand, and as a result, you discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>. You activate and resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>'s effect, adding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span> to your hand. Since this results in your hand having 7 cards once again, you now discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span>. You cannot activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span> effect at this point. If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect.
