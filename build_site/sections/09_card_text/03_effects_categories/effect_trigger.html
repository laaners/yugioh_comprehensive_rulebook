<h3>Trigger Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that are activated in a particular written timing are Trigger Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trigger Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects have a Spell Speed of 1. However, if multiple Trigger Effects activate at the same timing, they form a chain.</li>
  <li>Since multiple effects that activate during a particular phase like the Standby Phase or End Phase are not treated as activating simultaneously, after activating and resolving 1 effect, other Trigger Effects can be activated and resolved.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Trigger Effects do not activate if they meet their timing during the Damage Step. However, Trigger Effects that: activate mandatorily; activate when the monster itself is Special Summoned successfully; effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up; and effects that activate when the monster is destroyed, banished, or added to the hand, can be activated.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up activate in most cases when that monster is changed from being face-down to face-up on the field. When monsters with Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up are attacked and flipped face-up, the effects activate during the timing of "after damage calculation" of that battle.</li>
  <li>If a Trigger Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>

    <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent activates the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18094166">"Vision HERO Faris"</span> that Special Summons it from the hand, by discarding a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27780618">"Vision HERO Vyon"</span> from their hand. In this situation, when can I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If a monster is sent from the hand to the Graveyard as the cost of activating another card effect as in this scenario, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> cannot be activated by chaining to that card effect. After that activated effect resolves, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> can be activated in a new Chain.<br />Therefore, in this situation, when your opponent activates the second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18094166">"Vision HERO Faris"</span> that places a "Vision HERO" monster from their Deck face-up in their Spell &amp; Trap Zone, you can chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span>. (If your opponent does not activate the second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18094166">"Vision HERO Faris"</span>, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63413494">"Consolation Prize"</span> as Chain Link 1.)

<h4>Activation Location</h4>
<p>
  If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, but hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", but its location (On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck) changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >. Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <u>Question:</u><br />I have activated the effect of my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97148796">"Drytron Alpha Thuban"</span> by Tributing my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span>. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> was sent to the Graveyard.<br />In response to the activation of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97148796">"Drytron Alpha Thuban"</span>'s effect, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="24508238">"D.D. Crow"</span> was activated, targeting that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> in my Graveyard.<br />After this chain resolves, can I activate the effect of the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> that was banished?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the given scenario, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> cannot be activated.<br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> is Tributed, and sent to the Graveyard as a result, that effect can only be activated in the Graveyard. In other words, if, as in the situation given, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> is removed from the Graveyard after it was Tributed and sent there, but before the effect can be activated, that effect cannot be activated.<br />On the other hand, if the Tributed <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> is immediately banished as a result, such as due to the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span>, the effect of the banished <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> can be activated. In this case, if that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> is no longer banished by the time its effect can be activated - such as due to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48976825">"Burial from a Different Dimension"</span> - its effect cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>Question:</u><br />If a monster with one of the following effects is destroyed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75294187">"Terrifying Trap Hole Nightmare"</span>'s effect, and then also banished by that same effect, can their respective effects be activated?<br />1. "this card leaves the field" (e.g., the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44146295">"Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"</span>)<br />2. "this card is sent to the Graveyard" (e.g., the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>)<br />3. "this card is destroyed" (e.g., the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50237654">"The Dark Magicians"</span>)<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />None of the above effects can be activated.<br />Regarding the 1. (<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44146295">"Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"</span>) and 3. (<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50237654">"The Dark Magicians"</span>) options:<br />If these cards are removed from the field and sent to the Graveyard, these effects can only be activated in the Graveyard, and the card must remain in the Graveyard to activate the effect. In the above situation, the monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, then banished from the Graveyard. Therefore, the effects that activate "if this card leaves the field" or "if this card is destroyed" cannot be activated.<br />Regarding the 2. (<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>) option:<br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span> is an effect that activates in the Graveyard, in response to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span> having been sent there. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span> needs to be sent to the Graveyard, then remain there until this effect can be activated. Therefore, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span> is banished immediately after being sent to the Graveyard, its effect that activates "if this card is sent to the Graveyard" cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has been moved to a private location like the Deck or hand, the Trigger Effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.

    <summary>Example</summary>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> is activated discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> for the cost, and the same <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> is returned to the hand by the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> that says "add it to your hand.", the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> that activates "If this card is sent to the Graveyard:" does not activate.
