<h3>Other Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that do not belong to the Continuous Effect, Ignition Effect, Trigger Effect or Quick Effect categories are effects that do not belong to any category.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Those other effects are Monster Effects. As a result, if they are applied on the field they are negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> in most cases.</li>
  <li>Those other effects do not activate or start a chain. They are applied as conditions are met. Even if the conditions are met in the middle of the resolution of an effect, the effect is applied at that moment.</li>
  <li>
    The following effects are some examples of those other effects.
    <ul>
      <li>Effects of monsters that are not Special Summon Monsters that Special Summon themselves from the hand or Graveyard without activating.</li>
      <li>Monster Effects that keep applying while that monster is in the Graveyard or while they are face-down.</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this card would leave the field, banish it instead".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this card is Normal Summoned without Tributing, or is Special Summoned, its original ATK becomes [value].".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this face-up card is destroyed while it is in a Monster Card Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Card Zone as a Continuous Spell Card, instead of sending it to the Graveyard.".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can Set this card from your hand to your Spell & Trap Zone as a Spell Card.".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can only control 1 [X]".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "An Xyz Monster that was Summoned using [X] as Xyz Material gains this effect.".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
