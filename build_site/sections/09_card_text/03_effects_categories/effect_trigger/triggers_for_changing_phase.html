    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> by Tributing it, and that effect resolves. Afterwards, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50554729">"Amorphage Infection"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the situation you describe, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> is Tributed to activate its effect. When that effect resolves, it becomes the End Phase. Regardless, after <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span>'s effect resolves, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50554729">"Amorphage Infection"</span> can be activated.
