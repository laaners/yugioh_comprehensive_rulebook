  If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect.

    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />At the end of my End Phase, I have 7 cards in my hand, and as a result, I discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>. I activate and resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>'s effect, adding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span> to my hand.<br />Since this results in my hand having 7 cards once again, I now discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span>. Can I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span>'s "if this card is discarded" effect?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />No, you cannot.<br />If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect.
