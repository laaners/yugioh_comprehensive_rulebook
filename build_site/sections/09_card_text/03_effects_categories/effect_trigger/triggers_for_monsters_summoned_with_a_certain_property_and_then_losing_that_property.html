  Example: while
  <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span>
  is face-up on the field, Skill Drain is activated, and
  <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span>
  resolves in response, Special Summoning Harpie Queen. At the time that
  <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span>, its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". Afterwards, when the effect of Skill Drain applies, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is negated, and its name returns to being "Harpie Queen". Regardless, a "Harpie Lady" or "Harpie Lady Sisters" has been Special Summoned to the field, and the effect of
  <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span>
  must be activated.
