    You activate a card (1) that takes control of an opponent monster as Chain Link 1. (1) does not target. Your opponent activates as Chain Link 2 an effect that summons a monster (2). The chain resolves backwards, (2) is special summoned first, then with (1) you take control of an opponent's monster. If you take control of (2), after the chain has finished resolving, you are (2)'s controller. Therefore, if (2)'s has a Trigger effect on summon, you can activate its effect at this time<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
