<h3>Quick Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that can be activated when you have priority during the opponent's turn, providing a particular timing, are Quick Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Quick Effects have a Spell Speed of 2. They can also be activated in a chain to the activation of cards or effects.</li>
  <li>
    Quick Effects are classified in the following groups in most cases.
    <ul>
      <li>Effects that say "can also be activated during the opponent's turn", which can be activated arbitrarily during the opponent's turn.</li>
      <li>Effects that negate the activations of cards or effects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a Quick Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Quick Effects cannot be activated during the Damage Step. However, effects that negate the activations of cards or effects, or that increase or decrease the ATK/DEF of monsters, can be activated. Effects that increase or decrease the ATK/DEF of monsters can be activated only before damage calculation.</li>
</ul>
