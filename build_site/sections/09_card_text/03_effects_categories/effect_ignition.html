<h3>Ignition Effects</h3>
<p>
  Effects that can be declared to activate during the Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect, are Ignition Effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Ignition Effects start a chain when they activate<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are also Ignition Effects that activate outside of the field, like in the Graveyard or hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ignition Effects have a Spell Speed of 1<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an Ignition Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>

  <li>
    When a monster is successfully Normal, Flip or Special Summoned, that monster's Ignition effect cannot be activated immediately.<br />If, as in the situation given, a card such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53582587">"Torrential Tribute"</span> is activated, the monster's Ignition effect cannot be activated.<br />Also, if the monster is successfully Normal, Flip or Special Summoned, and no cards are activated by either player, the turn player can then take the next action, and activate the monster's Ignition effect.<br />(Even in this case, the Ignition effect is not activated when the monster is successfully Normal, Flip or Special Summoned, so it is not possible to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53582587">"Torrential Tribute"</span> in response.)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>

</ul>
