<h3>Ignition Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that can be declared to activate during the Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect, are Ignition Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ignition Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>There are also Ignition Effects that activate outside of the field, like in the Graveyard or hand.</li>
  <li>Ignition Effects have a Spell Speed of 1.</li>
  <li>If an Ignition Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>
