<h3>Continuous Effects</h3>
<p>
  The effects of monsters that are applied and keep applying as long as that monster is face-up in a Monster Zone are Continuous Effects. There are also Continuous Effects that have necessary conditions to be applied<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Spells/Traps also have Effects that work like Continuous Effect (Continuous-like).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Continuous effects do not start a chain and start applying the moment the monster is face-up<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      Since the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> that says "While this Special Summoned card is on the field, all Fairy-Type monsters you control gain 500 ATK and DEF." is applied immediately, the ATK of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> is 1700 when it is successfully Normal Summoned. As a result, a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29401950">"Bottomless Trap Hole"</span> that says "When your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK:" can be activated when the Normal Summon of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> is successful.

  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, Continuous-like Effects keep exerting their effects as long as they remain face-up<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster stops being face-up, leaves the field, or is determined to be destroyed, the effect stops being applied immediately. Even if the monster stops being face-up during the resolution of an effect, the effect stops applying at that moment<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>While you control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> and the opponent controls a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span>, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> is destroyed, since its Continuous Effect that says "Negate the effects of face-up monsters on the field that were Special Summoned from the Extra Deck." stops applying immediately, the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> that says "Any card sent to your opponent's Graveyard is banished instead." is applied and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> is banished. If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> are destroyed simultaneously by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span> or something similar, since neither effect is applied, they are not banished and are sent to the Graveyard after being destroyed.</li>
      <li>
        While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94853057">"Banisher of the Radiance"</span> are on the field, you resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span>, destroying <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> alongside other monsters on the field. Effects of cards such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> only apply while they are face-up on the field. Once they are destroyed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span>, or when they are leaving the field, their effects will no longer be applying. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> and all other monsters that were destroyed at the same time, as well as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span>, will be sent to the Graveyard normally<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster is destroyed by battle, the effect stops applying when that monster is determined to be destroyed during damage calculation<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continuous(-like) Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You control a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>. If you control a non-"Infernoid" monster, you can active it. If you choose to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>'s effect that sends "Infernoid" monsters to the Graveyard as part of the card activation, before that effect begins resolving, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> will be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect. As a result, you will then be unable to send "Infernoid" monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard.

<h4>Multiple Continuous Effects that interact with each other</h4>

<p>Cases when whichever card is face-up on the field <strong>first</strong> will take precedent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77585513">"Jinzo"</span> is summoned while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>'s effect is already applying, then <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>'s effect negates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77585513">"Jinzo"</span>'s effect. If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77585513">"Jinzo"</span> is already face-up on the field, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cases when whichever card is face-up on the field <strong>last</strong> will take precedent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62180201">"The Wicked Dreadroot"</span> is on the field, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62180201">"The Wicked Dreadroot"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span> is Special Summoned, the effect of the newly-Summoned monster will be the last one to apply<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span> is Summoned while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62180201">"The Wicked Dreadroot"</span> is already on the field, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span> will apply last, and its ATK/DEF will become the highest ATK on the field +100.</li>
      <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62180201">"The Wicked Dreadroot"</span> is Summoned while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span> is already on the field, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62180201">"The Wicked Dreadroot"</span> will apply last, halving the ATK/DEF of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
