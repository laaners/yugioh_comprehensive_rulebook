<h3>Continuous Effects</h3>
<p>
  The effects of monsters that are applied and keep applying as long as that monster is face-up in a Monster Zone are Continuous Effects. There are also Continuous Effects that have necessary conditions to be applied<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Spells/Traps also have Effects that work like Continuous Effect, (Continuous-like).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Continuous effects do not start a chain and start applying the moment the monster is face-up<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      Since the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> that says "While this Special Summoned card is on the field, all Fairy-Type monsters you control gain 500 ATK and DEF." is applied immediately, the ATK of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> is 1700 when it is successfully Normal Summoned. As a result, a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29401950">"Bottomless Trap Hole"</span> that says "When your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK:" can be activated when the Normal Summon of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> is successful.

  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, Continuous-like Effects keep exerting their effects as long as they remain face-up<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster stops being face-up, leaves the field, or is determined to be destroyed, the effect stops being applied immediately. Even if the monster stops being face-up during the resolution of an effect, the effect stops applying at that moment<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      While you control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> and the opponent controls a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span>, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> is destroyed, since its Continuous Effect that says "Negate the effects of face-up monsters on the field that were Special Summoned from the Extra Deck." stops applying immediately, the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> that says "Any card sent to your opponent's Graveyard is banished instead." is applied and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> is banished. If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> are destroyed simultaneously by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span> or something similar, since neither effect is applied, they are not banished and are sent to the Graveyard after being destroyed.

  <li>
    If that monster is destroyed by battle, the effect stops applying when that monster is determined to be destroyed during damage calculation<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continuous(-like) Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You control a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>. If you control a non-"Infernoid" monster, you can active it. If you choose to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>'s effect that sends "Infernoid" monsters to the Graveyard as part of the card activation, before that effect begins resolving, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> will be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect. As a result, you will then be unable to send "Infernoid" monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard.
