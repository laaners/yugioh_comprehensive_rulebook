<h3>Continuous Effects</h3>
<p>
  The effects of monsters that are applied and keep applying as long as that monster is face-up in a Monster Zone are Continuous Effects. There are also Continuous Effects that have necessary conditions to be applied<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Spells/Traps also have Effects that work like Continuous Effect (Continuous-like).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Continuous effects do not start a chain and start applying the moment the monster is face-up<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      Since the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> that says "While this Special Summoned card is on the field, all Fairy-Type monsters you control gain 500 ATK and DEF." is applied immediately, the ATK of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> is 1700 when it is successfully Normal Summoned. As a result, a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29401950">"Bottomless Trap Hole"</span> that says "When your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK:" can be activated when the Normal Summon of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> is successful.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, Continuous-like Effects keep exerting their effects as long as they remain face-up<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster stops being face-up, leaves the field, or is determined to be destroyed, the effect stops being applied immediately. Even if the monster stops being face-up during the resolution of an effect, the effect stops applying at that moment<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>While you control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> and the opponent controls a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span>, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> is destroyed, since its Continuous Effect that says "Negate the effects of face-up monsters on the field that were Special Summoned from the Extra Deck." stops applying immediately, the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> that says "Any card sent to your opponent's Graveyard is banished instead." is applied and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> is banished. If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> are destroyed simultaneously by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span> or something similar, since neither effect is applied, they are not banished and are sent to the Graveyard after being destroyed.</li>
      <li>
        While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94853057">"Banisher of the Radiance"</span> are on the field, you resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span>, destroying <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> alongside other monsters on the field. Effects of cards such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> only apply while they are face-up on the field. Once they are destroyed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span>, or when they are leaving the field, their effects will no longer be applying. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61528025">"Banisher of the Light"</span> and all other monsters that were destroyed at the same time, as well as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span>, will be sent to the Graveyard normally<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster is destroyed by battle, the effect stops applying when that monster is determined to be destroyed during damage calculation<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continuous(-like) Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />I control a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>. If I control a non-"Infernoid" monster, can I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> during my Standby Phase and apply its effect that sends up to 2 "Infernoid" monsters from my Deck to the Graveyard?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the situation you describe, you are activating a previously-Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> while the requirements for its "If you control a monster that is not an "Infernoid" monster, send this card to the Graveyard." effect are met.<br />Therefore, even if you choose to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>'s effect that sends "Infernoid" monsters to the Graveyard as part of the card activation, before that effect begins resolving, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> will be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect.<br />As a result, you will then be unable to send "Infernoid" monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard.

<h4>Multiple Continuous Effects that interact with each other</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    If a part of an effect asks to perform an action, and the effect of another card says that same action cannot be performed, in most cases the effect that says "cannot" takes precedence<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

<p>Cases when whichever card is face-up on the field <strong>first</strong> will take precedent:</p>

      <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span> is Summoned while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62180201">"The Wicked Dreadroot"</span> is already on the field, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span> will apply last, and its ATK/DEF will become the highest ATK on the field +100.</li>
