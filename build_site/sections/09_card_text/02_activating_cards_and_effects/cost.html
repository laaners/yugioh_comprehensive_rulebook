<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>
  To pay a cost is an action required by a player in order to activate a card, an effect, or to Summon a monster. Tributing to Tribute Summon a Level 5 monster is an example of a cost. Other common costs are discarding, paying LP, or banishing cards. You have to pay any costs before you declare the activation of the card<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the cost is written before a semicolon ";", at the start of a card effect or after the activation condition<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Costs must be performed at the time the card is activated, and even if the activation or effect of the card is negated, they are not refunded<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the player cannot suffice the costs, they cannot activate the card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Costs are not treated as card effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, costs can only be paid with cards in your possession<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
