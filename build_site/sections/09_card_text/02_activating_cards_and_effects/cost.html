<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>
  A cost is an action that must be performed in order to activate a card or effect, to perform another action, or to keep a card on the field. This is distinct from activation requirements, which are requirements that must be met in order to activate a card or effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the cost is written before a semicolon ";", at the start of a card effect or after the activation condition<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Costs must be performed at the time the card is activated, and even if the activation or effect of the card is negated, they are not refunded<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the player cannot suffice the costs, they cannot activate the card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Costs are not treated as card effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, costs can only be paid with cards in your possession<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Tributing cost</h4>

<p>In order to activate effects that read "Tribute [X];", those monsters need to be Tributed. The Tributed monsters are sent to the Graveyard.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Tributed monsters are not treated as being destroyed. As a result, they are treated as being sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>
    Even if the monsters that would be Tributed need to meet certain requirements, face-down monsters on the field can be sent to the Graveyard.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      A face-down <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75195825">"Master Pendulum, the Dracoslayer"</span> can be Tributed as a cost to activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16960351">"Dracocension"</span>, which reads "You can Tribute 1 Dragon-Type monster that has a Level; Special Summon, from your Deck, 1 Wyrm-Type monster with the same Level as the Tributed monster's original Level, and if you do, any monster destroyed by battle with that monster is shuffled into the Deck instead of going to the Graveyard.".

    </details>
  </li>
  <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, you can still Tribute monsters. In that case, the Tributed monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Costs that Discard from the Hand</h4>

<p>For costs that read "discard a card(s)", cards from the hand must be discarded from the hand in order to activate the effects. Cards that are discarded are treated as being discarded from the hand and as being sent to the Graveyard as a result.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    When paying costs that say "discard to the Graveyard", if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, the activation of cards that discard to the Graveyard as a cost cannot be performed. Costs that simply say "discard" can be paid. In that case, the cards are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished as a result.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74968065">"Hecatrice"</span> that says "You can discard this card to the Graveyard to add 1 "Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen" from your Deck to your hand." cannot be activated, but the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62015408">"Ghost Reaper & Winter Cherries"</span> that says "During either player's turn, if your opponent controls more monsters than you do: You can discard this card;" can be activated.

<h4>Costs that Send to the Graveyard</h4>

<p>For costs that read "send to the Graveyard;", those monsters must be sent to the Graveyard in order to activate the effect.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The monsters sent to the Graveyard are not treated as being destroyed.</li>
  <li>Cards sent from the hand to the Graveyard are not treated as being discarded from the hand.</li>
  <li>
    If a monster that would be sent to the Graveyard as a cost needs to meet certain requirements, a face-down monster on the field cannot be sent to the Graveyard.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      A face-down Plant-Type monster cannot be sent to the Graveyard to activate the cost of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95239444">"Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter"</span>, which reads "You can send 1 Plant-Type monster from your hand or face-up from your side of the field to the Graveyard;".
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or similar is being applied, so that the cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished instead and so that it is not possible to send cards to the Graveyard, activations that send cards to the Graveyard as a cost cannot be performed.</li>
  <li>Since Token Monsters are removed from the duel when they leave the field, they cannot be sent to the Graveyard for texts that say "send to the Graveyard;".</li>
</ul>
