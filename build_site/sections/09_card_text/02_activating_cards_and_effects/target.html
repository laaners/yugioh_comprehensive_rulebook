<h3>Target</h3>
<p>
  Targeting is the action of designating which specific cards are affected or used by card effects at the activation of a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  In Problem-Solving Card Text, cards and effects that target always explicitly state that they target: a card targets if and only if it uses the word "target"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cards can be targeted if they are on the field, in the Graveyard, or banished<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Cards in the hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >, Main Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >, Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >, or attached as Xyz Material<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> cannot be targeted.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot choose to use a card or effect that targets unless there is a card for it to target<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Targets are selected when the effect is activated. Even if the effect is negated, it is not forgotten that they have been targeted. However, if the activation of that effect is negated, the cards are no longer targeted<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card was targeted by a card or effect, but when the effect resolves that target has changed location, the target is no longer valid and cannot be affected as the target. The player does not get to change their target or select another target at resolution<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an effect is activated targeting 2 or more cards, and afterwards (before the resolution) 1 of them has been moved to a different location, the effect is applied, except if some particular requirement must be met<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53567095">"Icarus Attack"</span> was activated targeting 2 cards on the field. If 1 of the targeted cards is sent to the Graveyard by another card effect in a chain, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53567095">"Icarus Attack"</span> that says "destroy them." is applied on the remaining card.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards that have an effect that says they cannot be targeted for effects cannot be targeted to activate effects that target. After a card has been targeted to activate an effect, if that card is affected by an effect that makes it unable to be targeted, since it has already been targeted, the effect is still applied afterwards<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When the opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94192409">"Compulsory Evacuation Device"</span>, which says "Target 1 monster on the field; return that target to the hand." targeting a monster, if you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96864811">"Forbidden Dress"</span> targeting the same monster, that monster is affected by the effect of "Forbidden Dress" that says "until the end of this turn, that target loses 600 ATK, but cannot be targeted or destroyed by other card effects.", but since it has already been targeted for the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94192409">"Compulsory Evacuation Device"</span>, the effect resolves afterwards and it is returned to the hand.

  <li>
    Equip Spell Cards always target, but activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />The Quick Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> was activated by targeting an equipped Trap you control.<br />When that effect resolves, can I equip that Trap to my opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4167084">"The First Darklord"</span>, even though it cannot be targeted by card effects?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, you can.<br />That effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> does not require you to target any monsters. Thus, you can equip your Trap to a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4167084">"The First Darklord"</span> that cannot be targeted by your card effects.

      <u>Question:</u><br />Can I Special Summon the Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster I discarded as a cost to activate the effect of&nbsp;<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95503687">"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner"</span> with that effect?<br />Also, if it is possible, can I activate the effect if there currently is no Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster in my Graveyard that can be Special Summoned?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can Special Summon the&nbsp;Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster you discarded as a cost to activate the effect of&nbsp;<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95503687">"Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner"</span> with that effect.<br />It cannot be activated if there is no Level 4 or lower "Lightsworn" monster currently in your Graveyard.

    You control a card with an effect has multiple effects that you can choose (bulleted effects with "●") after paying a cost and the cost is the same. If:
    <ul>
      <li>The targets for one of the effects, "● effect 1", exist in the correct location, the card's effect can be legally activated and you can choose to resolve "● effect 1"</li>
      <li>The targets for another one of the effects, "● effect 2", don't exist in the correct location, the card's effect can still be legally activated but you can't choose to resolve "● effect 2"</li>
    </ul>
    But if after paying the cost of that card or effect, a new target appears that didn't exist before that is a target(s) for "● effect 2", and now "● effect 2" has all its targets now, "● effect 2" can be chosen at this time<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />If I detach a material in order to activate the first effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>, can I target that detached material as one of the cards to shuffle into the Deck?<br />Furthermore, if there are only two monsters in the Graveyard, can I detach that material and activate the "●Target 3 monsters in your Graveyard" effect?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect, you first detach a material, then choose which ● bulleted effect to activate, and target an appropriate card.<br />Therefore, when you choose which effect to activate, the monster you detached is already in the Graveyard, and can be targeted as one of the monsters to be returned to your Deck.<br />Additionally, if the only two monsters in your Graveyard are both Effect Monsters, you cannot activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect, as you do not have an appropriate set of target(s) in your Graveyard for either of the ● bulleted effects.<br />However, if there are two monsters in your Graveyard, and at least one of them is a non-Effect monster, this means that you could currently choose the "●Target 1 non-Effect Monster in your Graveyard" effect. Therefore, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect by detaching a material. If the detached material is sent to your Graveyard, and this results in you having 3 monsters in your Graveyard, you can then choose the "●Target 3 monsters in your Graveyard" effect as the effect to activate.

<h4>That target vs It</h4>
<p>
  The terms "that target" or "those targets" and "it" or "they/them" have specific meanings in the resolution of the effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "That target" and "those targets" indicate that targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution to be affected<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span> uses "that target". If "that target" it isn't a Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monster in the Graveyard anymore, it is not Summoned. For example you targeted a non-Zombie-Type Monster while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4064256">"Zombie World"</span> is face-up on the field, but <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4064256">"Zombie World"</span> is destroyed before the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span> resolves.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    "It" and "they/them" indicate that the targets do not need to meet the target requirements at resolution, only when targeted<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94119480">"Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"</span> says "destroy it". Even if the target was flipped face-down, or shifted to your side of the field, it's still destroyed.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    "Both (those) targets" and "all [X] targets" indicate that
    <strong>all</strong> targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution for any of them to be affected. If even one of the targets is no longer eligible, then the whole effect does not apply<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
