<h3>Target</h3>
<p>
  Targeting is the action of designating which specific cards are affected or used by card effects at the activation of a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  In Problem-Solving Card Text, cards and effects that target always explicitly state that they target: a card targets if and only if it uses the word "target"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cards can be targeted if they are on the field, in the Graveyard, or banished<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Cards in the hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >, Main Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >, Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >, or attached as Xyz Material<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> cannot be targeted.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot choose to use a card or effect that targets unless there is a card for it to target<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Targets are selected when the effect is activated. Even if the effect is negated, it is not forgotten that they have been targeted. However, if the activation of that effect is negated, the cards are no longer targeted<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card was targeted by a card or effect, but when the effect resolves that target has changed location, the target is no longer valid and cannot be affected as the target. The player does not get to change their target or select another target at resolution<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an effect is activated targeting 2 or more cards, and afterwards (before the resolution) 1 of them has been moved to a different location, the effect is applied, except if some particular requirement must be met<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53567095">"Icarus Attack"</span> was activated targeting 2 cards on the field. If 1 of the targeted cards is sent to the Graveyard by another card effect in a chain, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53567095">"Icarus Attack"</span> that says "destroy them." is applied on the remaining card.

    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards that have an effect that says they cannot be targeted for effects cannot be targeted to activate effects that target. After a card has been targeted to activate an effect, if that card is affected by an effect that makes it unable to be targeted, since it has already been targeted, the effect is still applied afterwards<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When the opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94192409">"Compulsory Evacuation Device"</span>, which says "Target 1 monster on the field; return that target to the hand." targeting a monster, if you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96864811">"Forbidden Dress"</span> targeting the same monster, that monster is affected by the effect of "Forbidden Dress" that says "until the end of this turn, that target loses 600 ATK, but cannot be targeted or destroyed by other card effects.", but since it has already been targeted for the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94192409">"Compulsory Evacuation Device"</span>, the effect resolves afterwards and it is returned to the hand.

    Equip Spell Cards always target, but activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />The Quick Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> was activated by targeting an equipped Trap you control.<br />When that effect resolves, can I equip that Trap to my opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4167084">"The First Darklord"</span>, even though it cannot be targeted by card effects?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, you can.<br />That effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> does not require you to target any monsters. Thus, you can equip your Trap to a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4167084">"The First Darklord"</span> that cannot be targeted by your card effects.

<h4>That target vs It</h4>
<p>
  The terms "that target" or "those targets" and "it" or "they/them" have specific meanings in the resolution of the effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "That target" and "those targets" indicate that targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution to be affected<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span> uses "that target". If "that target" it isn't a Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monster in the Graveyard anymore, it is not Summoned. For example you targeted a non-Zombie-Type Monster while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4064256">"Zombie World"</span> is face-up on the field, but <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4064256">"Zombie World"</span> is destroyed before the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span> resolves.

    "It" and "they/them" indicate that the targets do not need to meet the target requirements at resolution, only when targeted<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94119480">"Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"</span> says "destroy it". Even if the target was flipped face-down, or shifted to your side of the field, it's still destroyed.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    "Both (those) targets" and "all [X] targets" indicate that
    <strong>all</strong> targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution for any of them to be affected. If even one of the targets is no longer eligible, then the whole effect does not apply<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
