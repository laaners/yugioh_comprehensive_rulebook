    You control a card with an effect has multiple effects that you can choose (bulleted effects with "●") after paying a cost and the cost is the same. If:
    <ul>
      <li>The targets for one of the effects, "● effect 1", exist in the correct location, the card's effect can be legally activated and you can choose to resolve "● effect 1"</li>
      <li>The targets for another one of the effects, "● effect 2", don't exist in the correct location, the card's effect can still be legally activated but you can't choose to resolve "● effect 2"</li>
    </ul>
    But if after paying the cost of that card or effect, a new target appears that didn't exist before that is a target(s) for "● effect 2", and now "● effect 2" has all its targets now, "● effect 2" can be chosen at this time<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If I detach a material in order to activate the first effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>, can I target that detached material as one of the cards to shuffle into the Deck?<br />Furthermore, if there are only two monsters in the Graveyard, can I detach that material and activate the "●Target 3 monsters in your Graveyard" effect?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect, you first detach a material, then choose which ● bulleted effect to activate, and target an appropriate card.<br />Therefore, when you choose which effect to activate, the monster you detached is already in the Graveyard, and can be targeted as one of the monsters to be returned to your Deck.<br />Additionally, if the only two monsters in your Graveyard are both Effect Monsters, you cannot activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect, as you do not have an appropriate set of target(s) in your Graveyard for either of the ● bulleted effects.<br />However, if there are two monsters in your Graveyard, and at least one of them is a non-Effect monster, this means that you could currently choose the "●Target 1 non-Effect Monster in your Graveyard" effect. Therefore, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect by detaching a material. If the detached material is sent to your Graveyard, and this results in you having 3 monsters in your Graveyard, you can then choose the "●Target 3 monsters in your Graveyard" effect as the effect to activate.
