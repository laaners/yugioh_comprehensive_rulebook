      <u>Question:</u><br />Can the first effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="35330871">"Malacoda, Netherlord of the Burning Abyss"</span> be activated by targeting a monster with 0 ATK and DEF?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can target a monster with 0 ATK and DEF with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="35330871">"Malacoda, Netherlord of the Burning Abyss"</span>. For example, you can activate this effect by sending <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62957424">"Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> (ATK 1300/DEF 700) from your hand to the Graveyard, targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19665973">"Battle Fader"</span> (ATK 0/DEF 0). <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19665973">"Battle Fader"</span> will still have 0 ATK and DEF, but because the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="35330871">"Malacoda, Netherlord of the Burning Abyss"</span> was applied, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19665973">"Battle Fader"</span> is then equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56747793">"United We Stand"</span> and its ATK/DEF are increased, you must recalculate its ATK/DEF and include the decreased values.

      <u>Question:</u><br />Can I target a monster with 0 ATK with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75130221">"Code Radiator"</span> that was sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard as material for the Link Summon of a "<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53413628">"Code Talker"</span>" monster?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can target a monster with 0 ATK, as long as the "its effects are negated" effect can be applied to that monster.<br />The "its effects are negated" effect can primarily be applied to Effect Monsters whose effects are not yet negated. Additionally, Gemini monsters which are treated as Normal Monsters by their "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard." effect are also monsters to which the "its effects are negated" effect can be applied.
