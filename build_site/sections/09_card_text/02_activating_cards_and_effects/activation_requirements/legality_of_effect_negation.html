      <u>Question:</u><br />If the targeted monster's effects are already negated when resolving <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43685562">"Joruri-P.U.N.K. Dangerous Gabu"</span>, what happens?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In that case, the monster's effects cannot be negated until the end of the turn. Therefore, you also do not gain Life Points equal to that monster's original ATK.

Furthermore, during the Standby Phase of my next turn, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12817939">"Dark Lucius LV6"</span> that Special Summons a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58206034">"Dark Lucius LV8"</span> from my hand or Deck?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br /><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73417207">"Mara of the Nordic Alfar"</span> is an Effect Monster, even though it has no monster effects. Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12817939">"Dark Lucius LV6"</span> destroys an opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73417207">"Mara of the Nordic Alfar"</span> by battle, the effect that negates the effects of monsters it destroys by battle is applied normally.<br />Furthermore, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12817939">"Dark Lucius LV6"</span> that Special Summons a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58206034">"Dark Lucius LV8"</span> can be activated during your next Standby Phase.
