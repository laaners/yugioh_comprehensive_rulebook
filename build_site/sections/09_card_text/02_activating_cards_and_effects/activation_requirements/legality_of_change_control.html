    If you have no available Main Monster Zones, you cannot activate an effect that would take control of an opponent's monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Vice versa, you cannot activate an effect that gives control of a monster if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have 5 monsters in your Main Monster Zones before the resolution of an effect that switches control of a monster, the monster that would switch control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. In that case, it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />If there are no available Main Monster Zones on my opponent's field, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span> that gives my opponent control of a "Tindangle" monster on my field?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span> that gives your opponent control of a "Tindangle" monster on your field cannot be activated if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones. Furthermore, when resolving that effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span>, if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones, the targeted "Tindangle" monster cannot change control and it is destroyed. (That monster is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect, so even if the destroyed monster is <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="31759689">"Tindangle Hound"</span>, its effect that activates when it is destroyed by battle or card effect cannot be activated.)
