<p>Equip Cards with impossible Continuous Effects can be activated. A Link Monster can be equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38552107">"Horn of Light"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span>. However, since Link Monsters do not have DEF, the effect of increasing DEF is not applied. In the case of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span> , the effect that negates other Spells' effects targeting the equipped monster and destroys them is applied normally.</p>
