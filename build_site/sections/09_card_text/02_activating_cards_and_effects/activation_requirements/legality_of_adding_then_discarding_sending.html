    <u>Question:</u><br />There are currently no Dragon monsters and no Winged Beast monsters in my hand. Can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34116027">"Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34116027">"Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg"</span> even if there are no Dragon monsters and no Winged Beast monsters in your hand. If you do this, you will first add a Dragon or Winged Beast from your Deck to your hand, then discard that same monster.
