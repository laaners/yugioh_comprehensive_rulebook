<p>
  Effects of this kind can be activated even if resolution of that effect cannot be performed completely at the time of the activation. For example an effect that adds a card with a certain property from the Deck to the hand, can be activated even if there are no cards with that property at the moment of the activation<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />Can I activate the effect of&nbsp;<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40251688">"Infernoble Knight Captain Roland"</span> that can be activated when it is Synchro Summoned if neither an Equip Spell nor a Warrior monster is in my Deck?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can still activate the effect of&nbsp;<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40251688">"Infernoble Knight Captain Roland"</span> in question even if there is no Equip Spell or Warrior monster (or neither of them) in your Deck.<br />In this case, when performing the effect during the End Phase, you will first send an Equip Spell from you Deck to the Graveyard if possible. (If there is no Equip Spell in your Deck, neither that part nor the part of adding a Warrior monster to your hand is applied.)<br />Next, after you sent an Equip Spell from your Deck to the Graveyard, if there is a Warrior monster in your Deck at this point, you will add it to your hand. (If there is no Warrior monster in your Deck, the effect is completed by sending an Equip Spell to the Graveyard.)
