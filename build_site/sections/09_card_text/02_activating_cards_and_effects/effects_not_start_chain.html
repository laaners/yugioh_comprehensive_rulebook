<h3>Effects that activate and effects that do not start a chain</h3>

<p>There are card effects that activate and start a chain, and effects that are applied immediately without starting a chain if some requirements are met.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a Spell or Trap Card is placed face-up on the field, they always start a chain. This is called activating a card.</li>
  <li>Effects that keep being applied as long as the card remains face-up on the field (Continuous Effects of monsters; Continuous Spells; Field Spells; Equip Spells; Pendulum Effects of Pendulum Monsters; effects of Continuous Traps) are applied without starting a chain in most cases.</li>
</ul>
