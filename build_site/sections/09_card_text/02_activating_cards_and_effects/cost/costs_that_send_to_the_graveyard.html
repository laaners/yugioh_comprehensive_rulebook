      A face-down Plant-Type monster cannot be sent to the Graveyard to activate the cost of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95239444">"Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter"</span>, which reads "You can send 1 Plant-Type monster from your hand or face-up from your side of the field to the Graveyard;".

  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or similar is being applied, so that the cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished instead and so that it is not possible to send cards to the Graveyard, activations that send cards to the Graveyard as a cost cannot be performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since Token Monsters are removed from the duel when they leave the field, they cannot be sent to the Graveyard for texts that say "send to the Graveyard;"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
