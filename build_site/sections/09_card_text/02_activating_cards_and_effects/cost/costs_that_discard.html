  For costs that read "discard [X]", cards from the hand must be discarded from the hand in order to activate the effects. Cards that are discarded are treated as being discarded from the hand and as being sent to the Graveyard as a result<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    When paying costs that say "discard to the Graveyard", if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, the activation of cards that discard to the Graveyard as a cost cannot be performed. Costs that simply say "discard" can be paid. In that case, the cards are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished as a result<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74968065">"Hecatrice"</span> that says "You can discard this card to the Graveyard to add 1 "Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen" from your Deck to your hand." cannot be activated, but the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62015408">"Ghost Reaper & Winter Cherries"</span> that says "During either player's turn, if your opponent controls more monsters than you do: You can discard this card;" can be activated.

    Furthermore, cards banished in this way are treated as being banished by a card effect, even if they were discarded as cost<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48130397">"Super Polymerization"</span>, or activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="68468459">"Fallen of Albaz"</span>' effect, by discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> as a cost.<br />After this activation resolves, can the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span>, which activates if it is sent to the Graveyard or banished by a card effect, be activated?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In this case, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> was discarded as a cost to activate an effect. It was not sent to the Graveyard by a card effect. Thus, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> cannot be activated.<br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> is an effect that can be activated when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> is sent to the Graveyard by a card effect, or is banished.<br />However, if the situation above occurs while the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is applying, the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> will not be discarded to the Graveyard. Instead, it will be banished by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span>. As <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> was banished by a card effect, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36577931">"Despian Tragedy"</span> can then be activated.
