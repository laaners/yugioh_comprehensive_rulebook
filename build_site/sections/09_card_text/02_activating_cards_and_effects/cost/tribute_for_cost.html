<p>
  Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or activating an effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >. In order to activate effects that read "Tribute [X];", those monsters need to be Tributed. The Tributed monsters are sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Tributed monsters are not treated as being destroyed. As a result, they are treated as being sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if the monsters that would be Tributed need to meet certain requirements, face-down monsters on the field can be sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      A face-down <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75195825">"Master Pendulum, the Dracoslayer"</span> can be Tributed as a cost to activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16960351">"Dracocension"</span>, which reads "You can Tribute 1 Dragon-Type monster that has a Level; Special Summon, from your Deck, 1 Wyrm-Type monster with the same Level as the Tributed monster's original Level, and if you do, any monster destroyed by battle with that monster is shuffled into the Deck instead of going to the Graveyard.".

  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, you can still Tribute monsters. In that case, the Tributed monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
