<h3>Activation requirements/condition/legality</h3>
<p>
  An activation condition, also known as its activation requirement, is the set of conditions that must be met in order to activate a card or effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the activation condition is written before a colon ":", at the start of a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If some effect would be activated, and the resolution of that effect cannot be performed completely, it cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If the opponent does not control any face-up monsters, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97169186">"Smashing Ground"</span>, which has an effect that reads "Destroy the 1 face-up monster your opponent controls that has the highest DEF (your choice, if tied).", cannot be activated.
  </li>
  <li>Unless otherwise specified, the activation conditions only need to be satisfied when the card is activated, not when it resolves.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cannot "create" target through cost</h4>
<p>In order to activate a card (1) with a cost to pay and targets another card (2) for its effect (for example target (2) and Summon it from the Graveyard), a correct target (2) must be present (on the field, in the Graveyard, ...) before attempting (1)'s activation. Even if a valid target would be created after paying (1)'s cost, (1) cannot be activated.</p>
