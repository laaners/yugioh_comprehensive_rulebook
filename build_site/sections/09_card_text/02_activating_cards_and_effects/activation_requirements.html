<h3>Activation requirements/condition/legality</h3>
<p>
  An activation condition, also known as its activation requirement, is the set of conditions that must be met in order to activate a card or effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the activation condition is written before a colon ":", at the start of a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If some effect would be activated, and the resolution of that effect cannot be performed completely, it cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If the opponent does not control any face-up monsters, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97169186">"Smashing Ground"</span>, which has an effect that reads "Destroy the 1 face-up monster your opponent controls that has the highest DEF (your choice, if tied).", cannot be activated.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless otherwise specified, the activation conditions only need to be satisfied when the card is activated, not when it resolves<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Activation legality of targeting and paying cost</h4>

<p>
  You cannot choose to use a card or effect that targets unless there is already a card for it to target<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If, after paying the cost of that card or effect, a new target appears that didn't exist before, you can choose that card as the target of your new effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if paying a cost of the card or effect you want to activate would create a target for it, you cannot activate it unless the required number of targets already exist<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You control a card with an effect has multiple effects that you can choose (bulleted effects with "●") after paying a cost and the cost is the same. If:
    <ul>
      <li>The targets for one of the effects, "● effect 1", exist in the correct location, the card's effect can be legally activated and you can choose to resolve "● effect 1"</li>
      <li>The targets for another one of the effects, "● effect 2", don't exist in the correct location, the card's effect can still be legally activated but you can't choose to resolve "● effect 2"</li>
    </ul>
    But if after paying the cost of that card or effect, a new target appears that didn't exist before that is a target(s) for "● effect 2", and now "● effect 2" has all its targets now, "● effect 2" can be chosen at this time<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect, you first detach a material, then choose which ● bulleted effect to activate, and target an appropriate card. If there are two monsters in your Graveyard, and at least one of them is a non-Effect monster, this means that you could currently choose the "● Target 1 non-Effect Monster in your Graveyard" effect. Therefore, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="581014">"Daigusto Emeral"</span>'s effect by detaching a material. If the detached material is sent to your Graveyard, and this results in you having 3 monsters in your Graveyard, you can then choose the "● Target 3 monsters in your Graveyard" effect as the effect to activate.
