<h3>Activating Effects</h3>

<p>There are effects of Spell and Trap Cards that activate and start a chain in the Graveyard or field, other than when the card is activated by placing it face-up on the field. This is called activating an effect.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Ignition Effects/Trigger Effects/Quick Effects of monsters start a chain and constitute activating an effect.</li>
