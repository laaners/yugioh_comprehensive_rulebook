<h3>If vs When: Effects that Meet Their Activation Requirements in the Middle of the Resolution of an Effect or Chain</h3>

<p>
  If the Trigger Effect of a monster, or the effects of Spell/Trap Cards that activate with a specific timing, meet their timing during the resolution of a card or a chain, whether they can activate or not varies depending on 3 cases if they say "activate", "if [...] you can" or "when [...] you can"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Effects that say "activate if/when [...]" must activate (mandatory effect). As a result, if a chain or another card effect is resolving at the particular timing in which they activate, they activate after those resolutions are over<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3954901">"Felgrand Dragon"</span> is Special Summoned by a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> activated in a chain to a Normal Spell Card, the effect of the Normal Spell Card resolves immediately after the Special Summon. Afterwards, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3954901">"Felgrand Dragon"</span> that says "Target 1 monster in your Graveyard; this card gains ATK equal to that monsterâ€™s Level x 200." activates mandatorily.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that say "if [...] you can" can be activated if their meet their activation requirements during the resolution of other cards. If an "if [...] you can" effect meets its activation timing during the resolution of an effect/chain, you can choose to activate them after all those effects/chains finish resolving<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="60681103">"Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand"</span> is Special Summoned by a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> activated in a chain to a Normal Spell Card, the effect of the Normal Spell Card resolves immediately after the Special Summon. Afterwards, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="60681103">"Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand"</span> that says "If this card is Special Summoned from the Graveyard: You can target 1 monster your opponent controls or in their Graveyard; banish it ..." can be activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that say "when [...] you can" (optional effect) can only be activated during that timing<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. They must activate their effects immediately when that something occurs. If they cannot, or something happens between the time the condition is met and the next time cards or effects can be activated, then you miss your chance to use them<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. Examples and scenarios:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95833645">"Magma Dragon"</span> is Special Summoned by a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> activated in a chain to a Normal Spell Card (the activated Trap is Chain Link 2 or higher), since the effect of the Normal Spell Card resolves immediately after the Special Summon, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95833645">"Magma Dragon"</span> that says "When this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 Wyrm-Type monster in your Graveyard, except "Magma Dragon"; Special Summon it in Defense Position, but its effects are negated." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        If monsters are Tributed (for a Tribute<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup> or Ritual<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> Summon) or sent to the Graveyard to meet a Special Summon monster's summoning requirements (including Fusion<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup
        >, Synchro, Link), the Special Summon of the monster is performed afterwards. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can[...]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >. Some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Example: When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="46044841">"Gusto Falco"</span> is used as a Material for a Synchro Summon, that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="46044841">"Gusto Falco"</span> is sent to the Graveyard as a Material, but since the Special Summon of the Synchro Monster is performed afterwards, its effect that says "When this face-up card on the field is sent to the Graveyard, except by battle: You can Special Summon 1 "Gusto" monster from your Deck in face-down Defense Position." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14778250">"The Tricky"</span> (1) is Special Summoned by sending <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> (2) from the hand to the Graveyard, when the (2) is sent to the Graveyard to perform the Special Summon of (1), (2)'s effect that says "You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
            >.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Even if the effect of an activated card is negated, that effect is negated but its resolution is still treated as being performed so for example while the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51452091">"Royal Decree"</span> that says "Negate all other Trap Card effects on the field." is being applied, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is activated by discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> as a cost, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is negated, but since the timing is treated as that effect being resolved, the effect of the discarded <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> that says "When this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup
        >.
