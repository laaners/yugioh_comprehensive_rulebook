<h3>Effect Resolution</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    In most cases, when the rules and the written resolution of the effects are in contradiction, the written card text takes precedence<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the effect of a card is activated and that card is destroyed or otherwise moved to a different location, in most cases the effect resolves<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are multiple parts of an effect for a single effect of a card, they are resolved in the order in which they are written. Also, in most cases, if 1 of the parts of the effect cannot resolve, none of the latter parts are resolved (see conjunctives)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is not possible to make choices that would cause an activated effect to be unable to be resolved<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11193246">"Lunalight Reincarnation Dance"</span> that says "Add up to 2 "Lunalight" monsters from your Deck to your hand." it is not possible to choose to resolve the effect by adding 0 cards.

    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    If (at the time of the resolution of a single effect) both players need to resolve that effect simultaneously, the turn player performs the resolution first<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74519184">"Hand Destruction"</span> that says "Each player sends 2 cards from their hand to the Graveyard, then each player draws 2 cards." resolves, first, the turn player sends 2 cards from their hand to the Graveyard, then the opposite player sends 2 cards from their own hand to the Graveyard. Then, the turn player draws 2 cards, and finally the opposite player draws 2 cards.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    The effects of other cards cannot be activated during the resolution of an effect. If the activation timing for a mandatory effect is met during the resolution of an effect, it is activated after that effect finishes resolving<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the time an effect resolves, if the targets for that effect or the cards that it would affect no longer exist, the effect does not resolve<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are cases in which if an effect that needs to meet requirements at activation or that affects only some particular cards is activated, and later the card that activated, the targets for the effect, or the cards that it would affect no longer meet some particular requirements, that effect is not applied<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>For the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span> that says "Once per turn: You can send 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard, then target 1 Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monster in either player's Graveyard; Special Summon that target. This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect.", if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span> is no longer face-up as a result of a card effect being activated in a chain or something similar, the Special Summoning effect does not resolve.</li>
      <li>For the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="32542011">"High Tide on Fire Island"</span> that says "Apply the appropriate effects, in sequence, depending on the Attributes of monsters you control at that time.", if there are no WATER or FIRE monsters as a result of a card effect being activated in a chain or something similar, the effect does not resolve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if an effect fails to resolve properly, the activation timing is treated as if the resolution is performed. As a result, effects cannot be activated during the time in which that failed resolution is performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Effects resolve where they were activated</strong><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      This turn, if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10045474">"Infinite Impermanence"</span> that negates all other Spell/Trap effects in the same column for the rest of this turn is applied, not only will Spell/Trap Cards activated in the same column be negated, but also the effects of Spell/Trap Cards activated in the same column. In the given situation, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67775894">"Wonder Wand"</span> itself is sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate its effect, but the effect was activated in the same column as the previously resolved <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10045474">"Infinite Impermanence"</span>, so that effect will be negated.
