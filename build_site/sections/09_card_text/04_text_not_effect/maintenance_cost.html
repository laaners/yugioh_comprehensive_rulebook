Your opponent cannot target this Attack Position card with card effects. While this card is in face-up Defense Position, change all face-up monsters on the field to Defense Position, also negate the activated effects of monsters that were in Defense Position when that effect was activated.

  A maintenance cost is a cost required to keep a card on the field. They are typically paid during a player's Standby Phase or End Phase. If a player does not, or cannot, pay the maintenance cost of a card, then it will destroy itself (with the exception of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14258627">"Gaia Plate the Earth Giant"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70875955">"Aerial Recharge"</span>, which simply send themselves to the Graveyard)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Maintenance costs are not effects, so they cannot be negated and do not activate or start a Chain Link; even if a card like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>" or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77585513">"Jinzo"</span> is on the field and negating the card's effects, its maintenance cost still needs to be paid<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4694209">"Card Guard"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7153114">"Field Barrier"</span> cannot protect these cards from destroying themselves due to not paying their maintenance cost, since it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For <strong>mandatory</strong> maintenance costs (such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61740673">"Imperial Order"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36995273">"Degenerate Circuit"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="90590303">"Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"</span>), the player does not have the option of choosing not to pay the cost and letting the card be destroyed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If a mandatory maintenance cost requires LP and the player has exactly the specified amount left, since they must pay, they lose the Duel when the cost comes up due to reaching 0 LP (e.g. when the controller of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61740673">"Imperial Order"</span> happens to have 700 LP during the Standby Phase)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
