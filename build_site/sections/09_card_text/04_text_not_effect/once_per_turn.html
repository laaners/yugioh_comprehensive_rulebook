<h3>Text that specifies "once per turn": Activate vs Use</h3>
<p>
  Text that specifies the activation requirements for that effect, like "the effect of [card name] can only be used once per turn", is text that is not an effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p><strong>Activate:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If an activation is not negated, but later the effect is negated or is unable to resolve, the effect still counts as having been activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If "can only be activated once per turn" is written in a Spell or Trap Card, if the activation of that card is negated, another card with the same name can be activated again in the same turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If the activation of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98645731">"Pot of Duality"</span> is negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77414722">"Magic Jammer"</span>, if you have another copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98645731">"Pot of Duality"</span> in your hand, it can be activated again in the same turn.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    If "the effect(s) of this card can only be activated once per turn" or simply "once per turn:" is written (different from "the effect of [card name] can only be activated/used once per turn"), if that card is flipped face-down or leaves the field and it later appears on the field face-up once again, the same effect of cards with the same name can be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        However, if control switches to the opponent, the effect cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
        <details>
          <summary>Example</summary>
          You have activated the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29981921">"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En"</span> that negates the activation of a Spell/Trap Card. If control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29981921">"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En"</span> is now changed due to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98045062">"Enemy Controller"</span>'s effect, your opponent cannot use the same effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29981921">"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En"</span> this turn, even if they take control of it.

<p><strong>Use: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If "can only be used once per turn" is written in a Monster Card, if the activation is negated, that effect cannot be activated again in the same turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If "can only be used once per turn" is written in a Spell or Trap Card that is already face-up, if that effect has its activation negated, it cannot be activated again during the same turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If "the effect of [card name] can only be used once per turn" is written with a particular card name, if that card leaves the field and returns to the field in the same turn, that card or cards with the same name cannot activate that effect in that turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The same applies if "can only be used once per Duel" is written<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, if control switches to the opponent, monsters with the same name that the opponent controls can activate that effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    For cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66413481">"Fire King Avatar Yaksha"</span> that say "You can only use this effect of "Fire King Avatar Yaksha" once per turn", the text that says "this effect" only refers to the previous effect. The other effects of that card can still be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
