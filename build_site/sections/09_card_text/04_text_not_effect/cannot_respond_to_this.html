    <summary>Example</summary>
    You have just Tribute Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span>, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> is applying. You activate the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span> that returns a card to the hand. The text on <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span> that indicates that your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of that effect is not, itself, treated as a monster effect. Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> is applying to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span>, your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to you activating the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13073850">"Qliphort Stealth"</span> that returns a card to the hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    Text that does not grant this kind of protection to the card itself (so it does not say "this") <b>is</b> an effect. For example <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2347656">"Lovely Labrynth of the Silver Castle"</span>'s card text that says "Your opponent cannot activate monster effects in response to the activation of your Normal Trap Cards" is an effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
