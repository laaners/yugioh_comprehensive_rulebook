<p>
  Text that indicates that a monster cannot be a Material for a Special Summon monster, or that indicates the Special Summon Monster that can be Summoned using it, is text that is not an effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "Cannot be used as a Synchro Material" is text that indicates that the monster iself cannot be used as a Material<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. However, if the requirement also says "as long as this card is face-up" in cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="72714392">"Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor"</span>, that is a Continuous Effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    "If this card is used as a Synchro Material, the other monsters must be [X]" is text that indicates the other Synchro Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    "This card cannot be used as an Xyz Material for an Xyz Summon, except for the Xyz Summon of a DARK monster." is text that indicates the monster that would be Xyz Summoned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    "You can use monsters in your hand as non-Tuner Synchro Materials" is text that indicates the Synchro Materials in the hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The text "You can also use 1 monster your opponent controls as material to Link Summon this card" of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98127546">"Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"</span> is not an effect, therefore an opponent's monster that is unaffected by monster effects can still be used as a Link Material<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
