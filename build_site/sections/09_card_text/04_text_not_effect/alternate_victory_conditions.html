  Text that directly affects the state of the game like "you win the Duel" or "you win the Match" is text that is not an effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.

<ul>
  <li>
    Even if those conditions are met during the resolution of an effect, if those conditions are not met after all the parts of the effect finish resolving, a victory cannot be declared<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If the condition for <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33396948">"Exodia the Forbidden One"</span> that says "If you have "Right Leg of the Forbidden One", "Left Leg of the Forbidden One", "Right Arm of the Forbidden One" and "Left Arm of the Forbidden One" in addition to this card in your hand, you win the Duel" is met when cards are drawn by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79571449">"Graceful Charity"</span> that says "Draw 3 cards, then discard 2 cards", if the condition is not met after resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79571449">"Graceful Charity"</span> that says "then discard 2 cards", a victory cannot be declared<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If those conditions are met during the resolution of a chain, a victory can be declared after each resolution<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If you meet the Victory Condition of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33396948">"Exodia the Forbidden One"</span> by activating the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83968380">"Jar of Greed"</span> that says "Draw 1 card" in a chain to the activation of the opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15800838">"Mind Crush"</span>, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15800838">"Mind Crush"</span> is not applied afterwards and you win the Duel<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
