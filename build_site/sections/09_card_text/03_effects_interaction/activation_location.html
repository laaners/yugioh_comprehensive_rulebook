<h3>Activation Location</h3>
<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has been moved to a private location like the Deck or hand, the Trigger Effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.<br />
  Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> (1) is activated discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> (2) for the cost, and (2) is returned to the hand by the effect of that (1) that says "add it to your hand.", the effect of (2) that activates "If this card is sent to the Graveyard:" does not activate.
</p>

<p>
  If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location (On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck) changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
