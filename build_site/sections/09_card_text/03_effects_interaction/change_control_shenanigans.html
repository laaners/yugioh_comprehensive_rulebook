<h3>Change of control shenanigans with lack of space</h3>
<p>If your monster Zones are full you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cannot</strong> activate optional effects that would take control of an opponent's monster</li>
  <li><strong>Can</strong> activate mandatory effects that would take control of an opponent's monster</li>
</ul>
<p>Also you <strong>can</strong> activate optional effects that would take control of more than one opponent's monsters when you have at least one free Monster Zone, even if the number of monsters you would take control at resolution exceed the number of your free Monster Zones</p>
<p>After a successful activation of such card, if you do not have enough room in your Monster Zones, the extras are destroyed.</p>
