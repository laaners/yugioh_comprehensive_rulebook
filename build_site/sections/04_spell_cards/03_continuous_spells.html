    These cards remain on the field once they are activated, and their effect continues while the card stays face-up on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<ul>

    There are Continuous Spell Cards that have effects that can activate under certain conditions after their activation. In that case, this is treated as activating an effect and not as activating a Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If the effect of an already active <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="69868555">"Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords"</span> that says "Once per turn: You can send 1 other face-up card you control to the Graveyard;" is activated, the activation of that effect cannot be negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77414722">"Magic Jammer"</span> that says "negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it.".

    <ul>
      <li>
        Continuous(-like) Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

          <summary>Example</summary>
          <u>Question:</u><br />I control a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>. If I control a non-"Infernoid" monster, can I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> during my Standby Phase and apply its effect that sends up to 2 "Infernoid" monsters from my Deck to the Graveyard?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the situation you describe, you are activating a previously-Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> while the requirements for its "If you control a monster that is not an "Infernoid" monster, send this card to the Graveyard." effect are met.<br />Therefore, even if you choose to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>'s effect that sends "Infernoid" monsters to the Graveyard as part of the card activation, before that effect begins resolving, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> will be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect.<br />As a result, you will then be unable to send "Infernoid" monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The activated effects of Continuous Spell Cards are of Spell Speed 1. As a result, they cannot be activated in a chain to the activation of cards or effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effects of Continuous Spell Cards are invalidated immediately when they leave the field. Also, if a Continuous Spell Card that has already been activated activates an effect, and that Continuous Spell Card is destroyed by a card effect activated in a chain, the effect of the Continuous Spell Card does not resolve<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
