<h2>Equip Spell Cards</h2>
<div>
  <img loading="lazy" align="left" src="./images/icon_equip.png" alt="icon_equip" width="50" />
  <p class="space-left-4">
    These cards give an extra effect to 1 face-up monster of your choice (either your own or your opponent's, depending on the card). They remain on the field after they are activated. The Equip Spell Card still occupies one of your Spell &amp; Trap Zones<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    Equip Spells are activated by targeting the monster that they will equip. That targeted monster can be a face-up monster on the field/a monster in the Graveyard/a banished monster depending on the Equip Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Equip Spells can also be equipped to the opponent's monsters unless it is stated that they can be equipped to your or the opponent's monsters<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In most cases, a single monster can be equipped with many Equip Spells<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the activation of an Equip Spell is negated, it is not equipped, but if it has its effects negated, its effects are negated but it remains equipped<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the equipped monster leaves the field or is flipped face-down, the equipped Equip Spells are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. The Equip Spells are not treated as being destroyed by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.<br />
    This rule is also the same for equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the equipped monster no longer meets the requirements to be equipped by those Equip Spells, those Equip Spells are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. The Equip Spells are not treated as being destroyed by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the equipped monster is unaffected by Spell Cards, it remains equipped while being unaffected by the effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    After being equipped, if the card name or Type of the equipped monster changes so that the conditions for it to be equipped are no longer met, that Equip Card is destroyed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If a Warrior-Type monster equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84877802">"Magnum Shield"</span> (1), which says "Equip only to a Warrior-Type monster", has its Type become Spellcaster-Type by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74701381">"DNA Surgery"</span> that says "All face-up monsters on the field become that Type.", (1) is destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are Equip Spells that have effects that can activate under certain conditions after their activation. In that case, this is treated as activating an effect and not as activating a Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effects of Equip Spell Cards that activate have a Spell Speed of 1<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effects of Equip Spells, other than their effects that activate in the Graveyard, stop applying immediately when they leave the field. Also, if an Equip Spell that has already been activated activates its effect, and that Equip Spell is destroyed by a card effect activated in a chain, the effect of the Equip Spell does not resolve<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Equip Cards with impossible Continuous Effects can be activated<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: a Link Monster can be equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38552107">"Horn of Light"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span>. However, since Link Monsters do not have DEF, the effect of increasing DEF is not applied. In the case of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span> , the effect that negates other Spells' effects targeting the equipped monster and destroys them is applied normally.
