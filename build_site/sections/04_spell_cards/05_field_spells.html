    These cards go in your Field Zone and stay there. Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. These cards may be placed facedown in the Field Zone, but are not active until flipped face-up<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.

<ul>
  <li>
    If there already is a Field Spell in your Field Zone, you can activate or Set a new Field Spell in the Field Zone by sending that card to the Graveyard. In that case, the card sent to the Graveyard is not destroyed and it is not treated as being sent to the Graveyard by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. The Field Spell that is already in your Field Zone will be sent to the Graveyard <b>before</b> the new one is activated or Set.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    After activating a Field Spell, it remains in the Field Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, Field Spells keep exerting their effects as long as they remain face-up in the Field Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are Field Spells that have effects that can activate under certain conditions after their activation. In that case, this is treated as activating an effect and not as activating a Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In most cases, the effects of Field Spells that activate are of Spell Speed 1. As a result, they cannot be activated in a chain to the activation of a card or effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effects of Field Spells that apply on the field stop applying immediately when they leave the field. Also, if a Field Spell that has already been activated activates an effect, and that Field Spell is destroyed by a card effect activated in a chain, the effect of the Field Spell does not resolve<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
