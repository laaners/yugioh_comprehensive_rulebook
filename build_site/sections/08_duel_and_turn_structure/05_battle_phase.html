<h2>Battle Phase</h2>
<p>
  In this phase monsters can perform attacks<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You do not have to conduct a Battle Phase every turn, even if you have a monster on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The player who goes first cannot conduct their Battle Phase on their first turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Battle Phase is split into 4 steps and is conducted in the order shown in the diagram. The Battle Step and Damage Step are repeated each time you attack with a monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have finished attacking with all monsters in your Monster Zone and return to the Battle Step, you do not automatically proceed to the End Step. During the Battle Step after an attack is finished, you can activate cards and effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
