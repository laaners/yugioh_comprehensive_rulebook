<h2>Battle Phase</h2>
<p>
  In this phase monsters can perform attacks<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You do not have to conduct a Battle Phase every turn, even if you have a monster on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The player who goes first cannot conduct their Battle Phase on their first turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Battle Phase is split into 4 steps and is conducted in the order shown in the diagram. The Battle Step and Damage Step are repeated each time you attack with a monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the Damage Step of the Battle Phase concludes, you return to the Battle Step. Therefore, it is not possible to move straight to the End Step without entering the Battle Step. If, after you return to the Battle Step, no further attacks are declared, no cards are activated etc., you then proceed to the End Step<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
