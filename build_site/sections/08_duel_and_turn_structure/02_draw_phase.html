<h2>Draw Phase</h2>
<p>This is the first phase. The player whose turn it is (the "turn player")</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Must draw 1 card</strong> from the top of their Deck (<strong>except for the very 1st turn of the Duel</strong>). A player with no cards left in their Deck and unable to draw loses the Duel.</li>
  <li><strong>Can</strong>, after the draw, <strong>activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards</strong> before proceeding to the Standby Phase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The player who goes first cannot draw during the Draw Phase of their first turn.</p>
