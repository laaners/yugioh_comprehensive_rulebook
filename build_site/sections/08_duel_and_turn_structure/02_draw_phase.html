<h2>Draw Phase</h2>
<p>This is the first phase.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The turn player must draw 1 card from the top of their Main Deck at the beginning of the Draw Phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. This is called the normal draw<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The player who goes first cannot perform their normal draw during the Draw Phase of their first turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Neither player can activate cards before the turn player draws a card during the Draw Phase. As a result, no effects can be activated can be activated until a card is drawn, except for effects that have already been applied. As an exception, effects that say they resolve "instead of your normal draw", or say they are activated or resolved "before drawing", can be activated or resolved<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the turn player draws a card, if a player wants to activate a card, the turn player can activate cards first<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are no cards in the Deck and the player must draw but is unable to, that player loses<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both players pass the priority to activate cards, the Draw Phase ends, and afterwards, the Standby Phase begins<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot give up your Normal Draw if there are no cards in your Deck<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
