<h2>Standby Phase</h2>
<p>
  Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the Standby Phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a player wishes to activate cards, the turn player can activate cards first<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If effects activate or apply in the Standby Phase, in most cases they resolve starting from the turn player. Furthermore, if a player wants to activate a card or effect that has no specific activation timing like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>, they can also be activated or resolved in any order<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both players pass the priority to activate cards, the Standby Phase ends and Main Phase 1 begins<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Trigger Effect that activates in the Standby Phase has its activation negated, it cannot be activated again afterwards<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
