<h2>Standby Phase</h2>
<p>
  Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the Standby Phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a player wishes to activate cards, the turn player can activate cards first<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If effects activate or apply in the Standby Phase, in most cases they resolve starting from the turn player. Furthermore, if a player wants to activate a card or effect that has no specific activation timing like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>, they can also be activated or resolved in any order<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both players pass the priority to activate cards, the Standby Phase ends and Main Phase 1 begins<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Trigger Effect that activates in the Standby Phase has its activation negated, it cannot be activated again afterwards<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are multiple effects to be resolved during the Standby Phase or End Phase, or if each player has cards to pay for, or to activate<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >:
    <ul>
      <li>At the start of each Phase, the turn player has priority, and can activate/resolve their actions first. If they have multiple actions they can perform, there is no particular order in which they have to activate/resolve them. If the turn player chooses to give up priority, their opponent can also activate/resolve their actions (in no particular order).</li>
      <li>If both players have given up priority, if there are any actions that are mandatory to take, the turn player must activate/resolve those actions. If, after all mandatory actions have been dealt with, there are optional actions remaining, these optional actions can still be activated/resolved by the player with priority.</li>
    </ul>

      <u>Question:</u><br />If there are multiple effects to be resolved during the Standby Phase or End Phase, or if each player has cards to pay for, or to activate, is there some rule on the order in which all of these happen?<br /><u>Answer:</u>It is your turn, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87746184">"Albion the Branded Dragon"</span> is in your Graveyard, and your opponent has banished <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> using its own second effect.<br />Once you reach the End Phase, you, as the turn player, have priority. You must now decide whether to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87746184">"Albion the Branded Dragon"</span>'s effect. If you do not wish to activate it, you inform your opponent that you are passing priority. This returns in your opponent gaining priority, and they must decide whether to return <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> to the field. If they choose not to, they can inform you that they are passing priority back to you, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> remains banished for now.<br />At this point, you once again have priority, and must decide whether to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87746184">"Albion the Branded Dragon"</span>'s effect. Since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87746184">"Albion the Branded Dragon"</span>'s effect is not mandatory to activate, you can still decide to pass priority back to your opponent at this time. If you do, your opponent gains priority, and will need to return <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> to the field, since doing so is mandatory.<br />Once they have done so, you regain priority, and can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87746184">"Albion the Branded Dragon"</span>'s effect.
