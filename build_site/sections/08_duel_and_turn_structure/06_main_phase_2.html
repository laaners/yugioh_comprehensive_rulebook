<h2>Main Phase 2</h2>
<p><strong>If you conducted your Battle Phase</strong>, your turn moves to Main Phase 2 afterwards. The actions a player can perform in this phase are the same as in Main Phase 1. However, if the player already did something in Main Phase 1 that has a limit to the number of times it can be done, the player cannot do it again in Main Phase 2.</p>
