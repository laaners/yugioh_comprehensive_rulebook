<h2>Main Phase 1</h2>
<p>
  This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon, Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card's effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in any order you want, but some actions have restrictions<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. The turn player:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Can activate cards or effects that say "at the start of Main Phase 1" when the Main Phase 1 begins. These cards or effects can only be activated as the first activation of the turn player in Main Phase 1<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can Summon or Set a monster</strong>. There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can change their Monster's Battle Position</strong>. This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. You can change the position of each monster you control, except in three cases:
    <ol>
      <li>
        You cannot change the battle position of a monster that was played onto the field this turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        You cannot change it in Main Phase 2 if the monster attacked during the Battle Phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        You cannot change it if you have already changed its battle position once this turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can Activate a Card or Effect</strong>. You can activate Spell and Trap Cards, or the effects of Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster Cards as many times as you want during this phase, as long as you can keep paying any costs involved<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can Set Spell and Trap Cards</strong>. You can Set Spell and Trap Cards face-down in your Spell &amp; Trap Zone during this phase, as long as you have space<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>

  <li>
    After both players pass the priority to activate cards and the Main Phase ends, the turn player can choose to conduct the Battle Phase or to conduct the End Phase<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
