<h3>Damage Step</h3>
<p>
  In this step, the players calculate the result of the battle and whatever damage is done. After finishing the Damage Step, return to the Battle Step<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Even if the number of monsters the opponent controls changes during the Damage Step, a replay is not triggered<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.

<h4>Cards/effects that can be activated during the Damage Step</h4>
<p>
  ✔️ <strong>Counter Trap Cards</strong><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  ✔️ <strong>Mandatory effects</strong><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  ✔️ <strong>Fast effects that negate the activation</strong> of a card(s), or negate the <strong>activation of an effect(s)</strong><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  ✔️ Spell/Trap Cards and <strong>Quick/Quick-like Effects</strong> that <strong>directly alter the ATK/DEF</strong> of a monster(s), but <strong>only up until damage calculation</strong>. During damage calculation or afterwards in the Damage Step, they cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ✔️ These cards and effects do not have to affect a battling monster; they can be used during the Damage Step to affect the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) that is not currently battling<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ❌ Optional Spell/Trap Cards and Quick/Quick-like Effects that can <strong>indirectly change the ATK/DEF</strong> of a monster (such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77622396">"Reverse Trap"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>) <strong>cannot</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ✔️
  <strong>Trap Cards that equip themselves to monsters and have Continuous-like Effects that directly alter the ATK/DEF</strong>
  of the equipped monster, such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21350571">"Horn of the Phantom Beast"</span>, <strong>can</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ❌ Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15552258">"Half or Nothing"</span>, which <strong>might not alter ATK/DEF at resolution, cannot</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ❌ Cards such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84298614">"Powerful Rebirth"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18302224">"Reverse of Neos"</span>, which Special Summon a monster and exclusively <strong>modify the ATK/DEF of that Summoned</strong> monster, <strong>cannot</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ✔️ If a <strong>Set Continuous Trap Card</strong> has an
  <strong>optional Quick-like Effect that directly alters the ATK/DEF</strong>
  of a monster(s) (such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84389640">"Attack of the Cornered Rat"</span>), that Trap Card <strong>can</strong> be activated during the Damage Step until damage calculation, but only if that Quick-like Effect is activated and resolved in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ✔️ <strong>Continuous Trap Cards</strong> with <strong>Continuous-like Effects that directly</strong> alter the ATK/DEF of a monster(s), such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33665663">"Fire Formation - Kaiyo"</span>, <strong>can be activated</strong> during the Damage Step until damage calculation<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-4">✔️ Such Trap Cards <strong>can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect would not affect any monsters</strong>, such as activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9765723">"Dark Contract with the Witch"</span> during your own turn or while you control no Fiend-Type monsters, or activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25704359">"Unpossessed"</span> when a monster other than a "Familiar-Possessed" monster is attacking</p>
<p class="space-left-4">
  ✔️ Such Trap Cards can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect only applies an ATK/DEF change under particular conditions and those conditions are not currently met (such as activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98076754">"Chosen of Zefra"</span> while there are fewer than 3 "Zefra" monsters face-up in your Extra Deck), unless that condition could never be met during the Damage Step (such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="71934924">"Swift Samurai Storm!"</span>)<sup><a href="#">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-4">
  ❌ Even if a Continuous Trap Card can be activated during the Damage Step due to having a Continuous-like Effect that alters ATK/DEF,
  <strong>if it also has a Quick-like Effect that can be activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself</strong>
  (such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9765723">"Dark Contract with the Witch"</span>), <strong>that Quick-like Effect cannot be activated at the same time as the Trap Card's activation during the Damage Step</strong>, unless it has another valid reason allowing it to be activated during the Damage Step<sup><a href="#">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ❌ Unique exceptions are <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15684835">"Evil Blast"</span><sup><a href="#">[16]</a></sup
  >, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74439492">"Scrap Sheen"</span><sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup> (TCG only), <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17521642">"Zero Force"</span><sup><a href="#">[18]</a></sup
  >, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66742250">"Curse of Anubis"</span><sup><a href="#">[19]</a></sup
  >, and the Quick-like Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13317419">"Rocket Hand"</span><sup><a href="#">[20]</a></sup
  >, which have rulings stating that they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ❌ Unlike Quick/Quick-like Effects, <strong>having the effect of directly altering the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) does not permit optional Trigger/Trigger-like Effects to be activated during the Damage Step</strong>, with examples being <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43573231">"Morpho Butterspy"</span><sup><a href="#">[21]</a></sup
  >and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4239451">"Performapal Turn Toad"</span>
</p>
<p>
  ✔️ Optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects if that effect activates in response to the <b>card itself is Special Summoned successfully, being moved to a different location (destroyed, banished, added to the hand, etc.), being flipped face-up including Flip effects, or having its battle position changed</b><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[22]</a></sup> can be activated during the Damage Step, <strong>unless the effect performs a Normal</strong><sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup
  ><strong>or Fusion Summon</strong><sup><a href="#">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">❌ In general, other <strong>optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects that have activation conditions that can be met both during and outside the Damage Step cannot be activated</strong>. For cards that have Problem-Solving Card Text, these normally state "(except during the Damage Step)" (for example <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="68468459">"Fallen of Albaz"</span>) in their activation conditions. Otherwise, these effects are associated with activation conditions that involve actions regarding other cards, such as "When/If a [card] is destroyed", "When/If a [card] is added from [location] to your hand", "When/If a monster is Special Summoned", etc. of cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12469386">"Revival Rose"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36378213">"Ambulanceroid"</span>, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="39439590">"Cyber Dinosaur"</span>. This includes Trigger Effects of monsters that can activate in response to actions involving itself and/or other cards (but not just itself or other cards), such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26570480">"Madolche Chickolates"</span>; they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.</p>
<p>
  ✔️ Any effect that
  <strong>specifically mentions an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step</strong>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ✔️ This is indicated by phrases in the text such as
  <strong>"During damage calculation", "At the end of the Damage Step", "If/When you take battle damage", etc.</strong>
  (this includes cards and effects that activate
  <strong>in response to damage, without specifying battle damage</strong>, like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="60992105">"Blackfeather Darkrage Dragon"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63689843">"Attack and Receive"</span>, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2130625">"Numinous Healer"</span>)
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ✔️ If a
  <strong>Set Continuous Trap Card has an optional Trigger-like or optional Quick-like Effect with an activation timing at least partially specific to the Damage Step</strong>
  (such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30398342">"Yang Zing Creation"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44584775">"Damage = Reptile"</span>), that Trap Card <strong>can</strong> be activated during the Damage Step if that Trigger-like/Quick-like Effect is also activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="space-left-2">
  ❌ In contrast, if a <strong>Set Continuous Trap Card has a mandatory Trigger-like Effect with an activation timing at least partially specific to the Damage Step</strong>, the Trap Card itself <strong>cannot</strong> be activated, even if its controller intended on activating that Trigger-like Effect in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  A card only needs to meet one of the above requirements to be activated during the Damage Step. As long as it does not explicitly specify (except during the Damage Step), even if it fails to satisfy one of the above requirements, if it satisfies another one it can be activated during the Damage Step. For example, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="93382620">"Rope of Life"</span> Special Summons a monster and exclusively changes the ATK of the Summoned monster (like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18302224">"Reverse of Neos"</span>); cards with such effects cannot be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone, but since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="93382620">"Rope of Life"</span> also has an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step ("When a monster(s) is destroyed by battle and sent to your Graveyard:"), it can be activated during the Damage Step<sup><a href="#">[27]</a></sup
  >.

<h4>End of the Damage Step still occurs even if damage calculation was never conducted: "having attacked"</h4>

<p>
  A card whose effect reads "at the end of the Damage Step" can be activated even if damage calculation has not been conducted and Before Damage Calculation has been reached<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />My <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56532353">"Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"</span> attacks my opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26593852">"Ally of Justice Catastor"</span>.<br />At the Start of the Damage Step, the "destroy that monster" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26593852">"Ally of Justice Catastor"</span> is activated, however by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49010598">"Divine Wrath"</span> resolves in response, negating the activation and destroying <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26593852">"Ally of Justice Catastor"</span>. Afterwards, can I still activate the "at the end of the Damage Step, if this is the only face-up card you control, and this Fusion Summoned card attacked:" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56532353">"Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the situation you describe, the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26593852">"Ally of Justice Catastor"</span> that is being targeted for the attack is destroyed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49010598">"Divine Wrath"</span>, and therefore damage calculation is not conducted. However, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56532353">"Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"</span> is still attacking, and you can still activate its effect at the End of the Damage Step.
    <hr />
  </details>
</p>

<p>
  Also if an attack progresses until the Damage Step, that attacking monster is treated as "having attacked"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    An attack was declared with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83531441">"Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"</span> on an opponent's monster and the attack progressed until the Damage Step. Afterwards, even if the opponent's monster disappears and damage calculation is not performed, the effect that says "If this card attacks, it is changed to Defense Position at the end of the Battle Phase" is applied at the end of the Battle Phase.
