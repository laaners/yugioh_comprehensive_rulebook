<h3>Battle Step</h3>
<p>
  Select 1 monster on your side of the field to attack with, and 1 of your opponent's monsters as your attack target, and then declare the attack. If your opponent does not have any monsters on the field, you can attack directly. Play then proceeds to the Damage Step. Afterwards, the attacking player returns to the Battle Step, and repeats this procedure<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Each face-up Attack Position monster you control is allowed 1 attack per turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. If the attack was negated, the monster cannot perform another attack in the same turn, in most cases<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You do not have to attack with a monster if you don't want to<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Attack Declaration</h4>

<p>An attack declaration is performed in the following sequence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Choose 1 of your face-up Attack Position monsters to perform an attack.
    <ul>
      <li>If the opponent controls monsters, choose a monster as an Attack Target.</li>
      <li>If the opponent does not control any monsters, declare a direct attack on the opponent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After declaring an attack, the effects that activate/apply when an attack is declared or when a monster is targeted for an attack are activated and resolved starting from the turn player. After all cards are resolved, if a player wishes to activate an effect, the turn player can activate effects first.</li>
  <li>
    Cards that say they can be activated "when an attack is declared" can only be activated at the timing in which an attack is declared. Multiple effects that activate "when an attack is declaraed" can be activated providing they form a chain.
    <br />
    Example: If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56120475">"Sakuretsu Armor"</span> activated when an opponent's monster declared an attack would be negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77538567">"Dark Bribe"</span> or similar, if the chain that responds to the attack declaration and its effects finish resolving, cards that activate "when an attack is declared" like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56120475">"Sakuretsu Armor"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44095762">"Mirror Force"</span> cannot be activated afterwards.
  </li>
  <li>If no more attacks are performed by monsters, conduct the End Step.</li>
  <li>After an attack is declared and both players pass the priority to activate cards, the Battle Step ends and the Damage Step begins. However, if after attack declaration the attack is negated, or the attacking monster is changed to Defense Position during the Battle Step, so that it is not possible to continue with the battle, the Damage Step does not begin and damage calculation is not performed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Replay Rules during the Battle Step</h4>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/batte_step_replay.png" alt="batte_step_replay" width="180" />
</div>

<p>
  After you've announced your attacking monster and the attack target monster during a Battle Step, the attack target might be removed from the field, or a new monster may be played onto the opponent's side of the field before the Damage Step, due to a card's effect. This causes a "Replay". When this occurs, you can choose to attack with the same monster again, or choose to attack with a different monster, or choose not to attack at all<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Note that if you attack with a different monster, the first monster is still considered to have declared an attack, and it cannot attack again this turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Even if 1 monster leaves the field by the resolution of an effect and then 1 monster is Special Summoned, or something similar, so that the number of monsters does not increase or decrease, this is still treated as the number of monsters changing<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the number of monsters that the player who performed the attack declaration controls increases or decreases, a replay is not triggered<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a replay is triggered, an attack target is chosen to be attacked with that attacking monster<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the timing an attack target is chosen, is is possible to choose none and stop the attack. Even in that case, the monster is treated as performing an attack declaration and it cannot attack during the same Battle Phase<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a replay is triggered, when an attack target is chosen, this is not treated as "when an attack is declared".
    <br />
    Example: After a monster you control performs an attack declaration, the opponent activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> and Special Summoned a monster. You choose to attack the Special Summoned monster as a result of the replay, but at that time, the opponent cannot activate cards that activate "when an attack is declared" like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44095762">"Mirror Force"</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    After a monster that can declare a direct attack by a card effect declares a direct attack, if that monster becomes unable to declare a direct attack during that Battle Step by the effect of another card, a replay is triggered<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    After performing an attack declaration on a monster, if it becomes impossible to attack that monster during the Battle Step, a replay is triggered<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If an attack is performed on an opponent's face-up monster while the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99795159">"Ghostrick Mansion"</span> that says "Monsters cannot attack face-down Defense Position monsters, but can attack directly if all monsters their opponent controls are face-down Defense Position" is being applied, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14087893">"Book of Moon"</span> is activated so that the opponent's monster that was targeted for an attack is changed to face-down Defense Position, a replay is triggered, and if the opponent does not control any other face-up monsters, you can choose to perform a direct attack or stop the attack.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the number of monster changes during the resolution of an effect or chain, a replay is triggered after all those effects finish resolving<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If, at the time you declare an attack, the opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56120475">"Sakuretsu Armor"</span> (1) and activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> (2) in a chain, a monster is Special Summoned to the opponent's side of the field by (2), but since the chain is still resolving, (1) resolves before triggering a replay. As a result, your monster is destroyed by (1) and a replay is not triggered.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are effects that activate when a monster is Normal or Special Summoned, a replay is triggered after those effects finish resolving<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replays can only be triggered during the Battle Step. If the number of monsters changes during the Damage Step, a replay is not triggered<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
