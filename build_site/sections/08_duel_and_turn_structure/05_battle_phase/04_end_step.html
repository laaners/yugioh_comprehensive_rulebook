<h3>End Step</h3>
<p>
  After you've resolved all your battles by repeating the Battle and Damage Steps, and you have no more monsters you want to attack with, announce to your opponent that you are ending your Battle Phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    This step is the end of the Battle Phase<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an effect is applied "at the end of the Battle Phase", the End Step begins<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If players want to activate a card, the turn player can activate cards first<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If effects are activated or applied in the End Step, in most cases they are resolved by the turn player first. Furthermore, if a player wants to activate a card or effect that has no specific activation timing like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>, they can also be activated or resolved in any order<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that are applied "until the end of the Battle Phase" or "during the Battle Phase" are applied until both players pass the priority to activate cards during the End Step and after all cards finish resolving<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both players pass the priority to activate cards, the End Step ends, and then Main Phase 2 begins<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
