<h2>Winning a Duel</h2>
<p>
  Each player starts a Duel with 8000 LP (Life Points)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. You win a Duel if:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You reduce your opponent's LP to 0.<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    If your opponent is unable to draw a card<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. If an effect that makes the player add cards from the Deck to the hand, or send cards from the Deck to the Graveyard, or something similar is activated when there are no cards left in the Deck, this only causes the effect to become unable to resolve but the player is not defeated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card's special effect says you win (alternate victory conditions)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Life Points (LP)</h3>

<p>Both players have 8000 LP when the Duel begins.</p>

<ul>
  <li>LP is reduced through taking damage by battles or card effects.</li>
  <li>When the respective opponent of a player has their LP become 0 by battle damage or effects, that player wins the Duel.</li>
  <li>If you take damage by battle or card effects, or if you lose LP by an effect so that your LP is lower than 0, the LP do not become negative and they become 0.</li>
  <li>If LP is paid to activate a card or effect, you cannot pay more LP than your remaining LP. If the LP becomes exactly 0, the cost can be paid.</li>
  <li>If the LP becomes 0 during the resolution of an effect or a chain, even if it is known that there is an effect that would restore LP or something similar that would make the LP become 1 or higher, the player loses at the time the LP becomes 0.</li>
</ul>
