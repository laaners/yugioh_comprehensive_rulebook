<h2>End Phase</h2>
<p>
  Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the field which say "...during the End Phase..." in their text, resolve those effects in this phase. If you have more than 6 cards in your hand at the end of this phase, select and discard cards to the Graveyard until you only have 6 cards in your hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In most cases, effects that activate or apply during the End Phase can be resolved first by the turn player. Furthermore, if a player wants to activate a card or effect that has no specific activation timing like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>, they can also be activated or resolved in any order<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both players pass the priority to activate cards, the turn player must activate and resolve effects that activate mandatorily or that must be resolved during the End Phase first<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: You took control of an opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7634581">"Orichalcos Shunoros"</span> (1) that was Special Summoned during their turn by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23587624">"A Wild Monster Appears!"</span> (2) by activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="31036355">"Creature Swap"</span>, and then you activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23171610">"Limiter Removal"</span> (3) to double its ATK. During the End Phase of that turn, first, the turn player can choose to apply the effect of (3) that says "During the End Phase, destroy those monsters". If it is applied, (1) is destroyed and the effect of (2) that says "also shuffle it into the Deck during your opponent's next End Phase" is not applied. Otherwise, if the turn player does not apply the effect of (3), the opponent can choose to apply the effect of (2). If it is applied, (1) is returned to the owner's Deck, but if it is not applied, the effect of (3) is applied mandatorily and (1) is destroyed as a result.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trigger Effects that activated during the End Phase that have their activation negated cannot be activated again afterwards<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once both players pass the priority to activate cards and all cards have finished resolving, if the turn player has 7 or more cards in their hand, they choose and discard cards from their hand until they have 6 cards in their hand. Cards discarded at this time are treated as being "discarded from the hand" and "sent from the hand to the Garveyard". However, they are not treated as being "discarded by an effect" or "sent to the Graveyard by an effect"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If the turn player has 7 cards in their hand during the End Phase and they discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34230233">"Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World"</span> to reduce the hand size to 6 cards, the effect that says "If this card is discarded to the Graveyard by a card effect" does not activate. Also, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19163116">"Gem-Knight Obsidian"</span> is discarded, its effect that says "If this card is sent from the hand to your Graveyard" activates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that say <strong>"until the end of the turn"</strong> are applied until both players have passed the priority to activate cards, have finished adjusting the hand size, and finished all the resolutions during the End Phase<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the End Phase is over, the Draw Phase of the opponent's turn begins<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
