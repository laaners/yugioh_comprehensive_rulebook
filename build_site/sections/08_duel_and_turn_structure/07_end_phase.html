<h2>End Phase</h2>
<p>
  Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the field which say "during the End Phase" in their text, resolve those effects in this phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In most cases, effects that activate or apply during the End Phase can be resolved first by the turn player. Furthermore, if a player wants to activate a card or effect that has no specific activation timing like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>, they can also be activated or resolved in any order<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both players pass the priority to activate cards, the turn player must activate and resolve effects that activate mandatorily or that must be resolved during the End Phase first<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. The order in which a player resolves the End Phase effects is decided by the player<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.

      <u>Question:</u><br />A face-up <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76375976">"Mystic Mine"</span> is in my opponent's Field Zone, a face-down Defense Position monster is in my Monster Zone, and a face-up Attack Position <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000080">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"</span> that I Tribute Summoned to my opponent's field is in my opponent's Monster Zone. During my opponent's End Phase, what is the procedure involving <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000080">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"</span> returning to its owner's control and the effect that destroys <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76375976">"Mystic Mine"</span> activating?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In this scenario, both <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76375976">"Mystic Mine"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000080">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"</span> are controlled by your opponent, and your opponent is the turn player. In this case, your opponent can choose to either first activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76375976">"Mystic Mine"</span> or to return <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000080">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"</span> to its owner. (If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000080">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"</span> returns to your field first, the number of monsters on each side will no longer be equal, so the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76375976">"Mystic Mine"</span> will not activate as a result.)

    Effects that say <strong>"until the end of the turn"</strong> are applied until both players have passed the priority to activate cards, have finished adjusting the hand size, and finished all the resolutions during the End Phase<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

<h3>Hand size limit</h3>
<p>
  Once both players pass the priority to activate cards and all cards have finished resolving, if the turn player has 7 or more cards in their hand, they choose and discard cards from their hand until they have 6 cards in their hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cards discarded at this time are treated as being "discarded from the hand" and "sent from the hand to the Garveyard". However, they are not treated as being "discarded by an effect" or "sent to the Graveyard by an effect"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If the turn player has 7 cards in their hand during the End Phase and they discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34230233">"Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World"</span> to reduce the hand size to 6 cards, the effect that says "If this card is discarded to the Graveyard by a card effect" does not activate. Also, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19163116">"Gem-Knight Obsidian"</span> is discarded, its effect that says "If this card is sent from the hand to your Graveyard" activates.

    Once you start discarding for hand size, the game state never again becomes open: effects that require the an open game state cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase, can I activate its effect that adds a Level 3 DARK Fiend-Type monster from my Deck to my hand immediately?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> does not start a chain at the time it is sent to the Graveyard.<br />Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase, you cannot activate its effect immediately at that time.<br />Similarly, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is discarded for your hand size limit, you cannot activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span>.

    If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.

      <u>Question:</u><br />At the end of my End Phase, I have 7 cards in my hand, and as a result, I discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>. I activate and resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>'s effect, adding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span> to my hand.<br />Since this results in my hand having 7 cards once again, I now discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span>. Can I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span>'s "if this card is discarded" effect?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />No, you cannot.<br />If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect.
