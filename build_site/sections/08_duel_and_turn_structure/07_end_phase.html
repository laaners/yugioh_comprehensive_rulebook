<h2>End Phase</h2>
<p>
  Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the field which say "during the End Phase" in their text, resolve those effects in this phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In most cases, effects that activate or apply during the End Phase can be resolved first by the turn player. Furthermore, if a player wants to activate a card or effect that has no specific activation timing like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>, they can also be activated or resolved in any order<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If both players pass the priority to activate cards, the turn player must activate and resolve effects that activate mandatorily or that must be resolved during the End Phase first<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. The order in which a player resolves the End Phase effects is decided by the player<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You took control of an opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7634581">"Orichalcos Shunoros"</span> that was Special Summoned during their turn by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23587624">"A Wild Monster Appears!"</span> by activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="31036355">"Creature Swap"</span>, and then you activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23171610">"Limiter Removal"</span> to double its ATK. During the End Phase of that turn, first, the turn player can choose to apply the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23171610">"Limiter Removal"</span> that says "During the End Phase, destroy those monsters". If it is applied, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7634581">"Orichalcos Shunoros"</span> is destroyed and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7634581">"Orichalcos Shunoros"</span> that says "also shuffle it into the Deck during your opponent's next End Phase" is not applied. Otherwise, if the turn player does not apply the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23171610">"Limiter Removal"</span>, the opponent can choose to apply the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7634581">"Orichalcos Shunoros"</span>. If it is applied, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7634581">"Orichalcos Shunoros"</span> is returned to the owner's Deck, but if it is not applied, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23171610">"Limiter Removal"</span> is applied mandatorily and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7634581">"Orichalcos Shunoros"</span> is destroyed as a result.

<h3>Hand size limit</h3>
<p>
  Once both players pass the priority to activate cards and all cards have finished resolving, if the turn player has 7 or more cards in their hand, they choose and discard cards from their hand until they have 6 cards in their hand<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cards discarded at this time are treated as being "discarded from the hand" and "sent from the hand to the Garveyard". However, they are not treated as being "discarded by an effect" or "sent to the Graveyard by an effect"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If the turn player has 7 cards in their hand during the End Phase and they discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34230233">"Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World"</span> to reduce the hand size to 6 cards, the effect that says "If this card is discarded to the Graveyard by a card effect" does not activate. Also, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19163116">"Gem-Knight Obsidian"</span> is discarded, its effect that says "If this card is sent from the hand to your Graveyard" activates.

    Once you start discarding for hand size, the game state never again becomes open<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase. The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> does not start a chain at the time it is sent to the Graveyard. Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase, you cannot activate its effect immediately at that time. Similarly, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is discarded for your hand size limit, you cannot activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span>.

    If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      At the end of your End Phase, you have 7 cards in your hand, and as a result, you discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>. You activate and resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70711847">"Danger! Nessie!"</span>'s effect, adding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span> to your hand. Since this results in your hand having 7 cards once again, you now discard <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span>. You cannot activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43316238">"Danger! Bigfoot!"</span> effect at this point. If you discard cards for hand size at the end of your End Phase, you can only activate effects on the Chain immediately following this. Even if, at some point after this first Chain, some other effect meets its activation condition, you cannot activate that effect.
