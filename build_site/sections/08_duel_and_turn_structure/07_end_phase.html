<h2>End Phase</h2>
<p>Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the field which say "...during the End Phase..." in their text, resolve those effects in this phase. If you have more than 6 cards in your hand at the end of this phase, select and discard cards to the Graveyard until you only have 6 cards in your hand.</p>
