<h3>Battle Damage</h3>
<p>Damage inflicted to the LP as a result of monsters battling is called battle damage. To reiterate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The damage taken by a player from a Defense Position monster is also battle damage.</li>
  <li>The damage from effects that say "inflict battle damage" is not treated as effect damage, and it is treated as battle damage.</li>

<h4>Determining Battle Damage and Battle Destruction</h4>
<p>
  You calculate battle damage based on the battle position of the monster you are attacking. If you attack an Attack Position monster, compare ATK vs. ATK. If you attack a Defense Position monster, compare your monster's ATK vs. the attacked monster's DEF<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.

<h4>Modifying Battle Damage</h4>

<p>
  There also exist effects that modify battle damage by doubling it, make your opponent take it instead, reduce it to zero, gain life points instead of taking it and so on. In such cases battle damage is determined by considering different types of effects in the following order<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >:
</p>
<ol class="battle-damage-ol">
  <li>This card inflicts double battle damage (this phrasing exactly with "battle damage" as object of the phrase, in Japanese it is "倍の戦闘ダメージを与える").</li>
  <li>Battle damage is taken by both players.</li>
  <li>Battle damage you take is also inflicted to your opponent / your opponent takes any battle damage you would take instead.</li>
  <li>Battle damage is treated as effect damage.</li>
  <li>The player gains Life Points instead of taking battle damage.</li>
  <li>Battle damage becomes 0.</li>
  <li>Battle damage is halved.</li>
  <li>Battle damage is doubled (this phrasing exactly with "battle damage" as subject of the phrase, in Japanese it is "戦闘ダメージは倍になる").</li>
  <li>Battle damage becomes [value].</li>
  <li>You do not take battle damage if it is more or less than [value] (however, note that if the Battle Damage has become 0 when applying "06" effects, the remaining effects are not applied).</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Take as an example <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81260679">"Ohime the Manifested Mikanko"</span> (effect type "03") equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41927278">"Double-Edged Sword"</span> (effect type "02"), so that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81260679">"Ohime the Manifested Mikanko"</span>'s ATK is 2000<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<h3>Effect Damage</h3>

<p>Damage inflicted to the LP as a result of an effect is called effect damage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Inflicting 0 damage is still something that happened<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      Your opponent has just resolved the first effect of their <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44373896">"Destruction Dragon"</span>, which was activated by targeting a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30312361">"Phantom of Chaos"</span> in your Monster Zone. In this situation, a monster you control was destroyed by the effect of your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44373896">"Destruction Dragon"</span>. Even though the ATK of your destroyed <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30312361">"Phantom of Chaos"</span> is zero, the "if it was a Monster Card, inflict damage to your opponent equal to its original ATK" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44373896">"Destruction Dragon"</span> is still also applied (you will take 0 damage as a result of this). So you cannot activate a card like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37383714">"Soul Rope"</span> that needs the last action to happen to be the destruction of the monster, as the last action happened was you taking 0 damage.
