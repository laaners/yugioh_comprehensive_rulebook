  <li>If damage is taken by an effect, that player's LP is reduced by that amount.</li>
  <li>
    If LP is paid for a cost or LP is lost by an effect, this is not treated as taking damage.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When you lose LP by the clause of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="54447022">"Soul Charge"</span> that says "Special Summon them, and if you do, you lose 1000 LP for each monster Special Summoned by this effect.", the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="92536468">"D/D/D Rebel King Leonidas"</span> that says "You take no effect damage." cannot be applied.

  </li>
  <li>an effect reads "inflict battle damage" like effects that say "when it attacks a Defense Position monster, inflict piercing battle damage to your opponent", that damage is treated as battle damage.</li>
  <li>For effects that make the opponent take the battle damage you would take, the battle damage that is exchanged is treated as battle damage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Battle Damage</h3>
<p>Damage inflicted to the LP as a result of monsters battling is called battle damage. To reiterate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The damage taken by a player from a Defense Position monster is also battle damage.</li>
  <li>The damage from effects that say "inflict battle damage" is not treated as effect damage, and it is treated as battle damage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inflicting 0 damage is still something that happened</h3>

  Inflicting 0 damage is still something that happened.

    <summary>Example</summary>
    Your opponent has just resolved the first effect of their <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44373896">"Destruction Dragon"</span>, which was activated by targeting a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30312361">"Phantom of Chaos"</span> in your Monster Zone. In this situation, a monster you control was destroyed by the effect of your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44373896">"Destruction Dragon"</span>. Even though the ATK of your destroyed <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30312361">"Phantom of Chaos"</span> is zero, the "if it was a Monster Card, inflict damage to your opponent equal to its original ATK" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44373896">"Destruction Dragon"</span> is still also applied (you will take 0 damage as a result of this). So you cannot activate a card like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37383714">"Soul Rope"</span> that needs the last action to happen to be the destruction of the monster, as the last action happened was you taking 0 damage.
