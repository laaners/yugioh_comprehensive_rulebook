<ul>
  <li>If damage is taken by an effect, that player's LP is reduced by that amount.</li>
  <li>
    If LP is paid for a cost or LP is lost by an effect, this is not treated as taking damage.
    <br />
    Example: When you lose LP by the clause of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="54447022">"Soul Charge"</span> that says "Special Summon them, and if you do, you lose 1000 LP for each monster Special Summoned by this effect.", the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="92536468">"D/D/D Rebel King Leonidas"</span> that says "You take no effect damage." cannot be applied.
  </li>
  <li>an effect reads "inflict battle damage" like effects that say "when it attacks a Defense Position monster, inflict piercing battle damage to your opponent", that damage is treated as battle damage.</li>
  <li>For effects that make the opponent take the battle damage you would take, the battle damage that is exchanged is treated as battle damage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Battle Damage</h3>

<p>Damage inflicted to the LP as a result of monsters battling is called battle damage. To reiterate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The damage taken by a player from a Defense Position monster is also battle damage.</li>
  <li>The damage from effects that say "inflict battle damage" is not treated as effect damage, and it is treated as battle damage.</li>
</ul>
