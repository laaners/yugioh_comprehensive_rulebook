<h2>Chains</h2>

<p>
  To activate is to use a card or effect in a way that makes a Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Activating a card</strong>: when the card is placed face-up on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Activating an effect</strong>: when the effect of a card that is already face-up is activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Chains are a way to order the resolution of multiple card effects. They are used when the effects of more than 1 card are activated at once, or when a player wants to use an effect after a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the game<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  If a card's effect is activated, the opponent is always given a chance to respond with a card effect of their own, creating a Chain. If your opponent responds with an effect, then you can choose to respond and add another effect to the Chain. If your opponent does not respond, you may activate a second effect and create a Chain to your own card's activation. Both players continue to add effects to the Chain until they both wish to add nothing else, then you resolve the outcome in reverse order - starting with the last card that was activated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  As shown in the diagram, the first effect activated is Chain Link 1. The next effect is Chain Link 2, and so on. Every time a new Chain Link is made, they are stacked up in the order that the cards are activated. Once the Chain is completed, the outcome is resolved starting with the most recent card to be activated at the top of the Chain and proceeding down to Chain Link 1<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.

<h3>Spell Speed</h3>

<p>Every type of card effect has a Spell Speed between 1 and 3. If you want to respond to a card effect in a Chain, you have to use an effect with Spell Speed 2 or higher, and it cannot have a lower Spell Speed than the effect you are responding to. Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster effects have different Spell Speeds. There are Spell Speeds from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it.</p>

<table align="center">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Spell Speed 1</b></td>
      <td>
        Includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Spells (Normal, Equip, Continuous, Field, Ritual),</li>
          <li>Effect Monster's effects (Ignition, Trigger, and Flip)</li>
        </ul>
        This is the slowest of all Spell Speeds. These cards cannot be activated in response to any other effects. Typically, these effects cannot be Chain Link 2 or higher, unless multiple Spell Speed 1 effects are activated simultaneously.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Spell Speed 2</b></td>
      <td>
        Includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Traps (Normal, Continuous)</li>
          <li>Quick-Play Spells</li>
          <li>Effect Monster's Quick Effects</li>
        </ul>
        These cards can be used to respond to a Spell Speed 1 or 2 effect, and can typically be activated during any phase.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Spell Speed 3</b></td>
      <td>
        Includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Counter Trap</li>
        </ul>
        This is the fastest of all Spell Speeds and can be used to respond to a card of any Spell Speed. Only another Spell Speed 3 card may be used to respond to these cards.

<h3>Actions which cannot be Chained to</h3>

<p>You can only create a Chain by responding to the activation of a card or effect. Summoning a monster, Tributing, changing a monster's battle position and paying costs are not effect activations and therefore you cannot respond to those actions using a Chain.</p>

<h3>Cards are sent to the Graveyard only at chain resolution</h3>
<p>
  Cards are sent to the Graveyard only at chain resolution.
  <br />
  Example: during your opponent's Battle Phase, you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18235309">"Escalation of the Monarchs"</span>. Furthermore, you chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span> and target 2 of your opponent's Spell/Trap Cards to destroy. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82697428">"Vision HERO Witch Raider"</span> is a Level 8 monster that requires 2 Tributes, but you can also Tribute Trap Cards on your field as well as monsters when Tribute Summoning it. In this scenario, when the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18235309">"Escalation of the Monarchs"</span> is applied and the Tribute Summon is performed, there are 2 Trap Cards on your field, so you may Tribute them to Tribute Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82697428">"Vision HERO Witch Raider"</span> face-up
