<h2>Fast effect timing</h2>

<p>Fast effects are card activations and effects with a Spell Speed of 2 or higher, including monster Quick Effects, Quick-Play Spell Cards, and Trap Cards (which includes both activating Trap Cards, and activating the effects of things like Continuous Trap Cards).</p>

<p>Fast effects can be activated by either player - even during their opponent's turn, as long as the conditions are appropriate. When both players want to activate fast effects at the same time, they are placed on a Chain.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it can make a big difference WHO places their fast effect on the Chain first: this can determine who "goes next".</p>
<ul>
  <li>Usually, the turn player has the chance to "go next" and activate the next fast effect.</li>
  <li>However, during a Chain, the chance to go next passes back and forth between players.</li>
  <li>Also, if the turn player doesn't wish to take any actions, and instead wants to move along in the turn (for example, to the next Step or Phase), the opponent has an opportunity to go next, and activate a fast effect, before the turn proceeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the <a href="#fast_effect_timing_flowchart">chart</a> to see which player can "go next" regarding fast effects.</p>

<h3>Game state and Turn Player Actions</h3>

<p>Each Phase and Step starts with the turn player in box A of the chart listed below. This is when the game state is <strong>"open"</strong>, meaning the turn player has complete freedom of action.</p>

<p>Many actions can ONLY be performed when the game state is open (when you're in box A). Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal Summon (including Tribute Summon)</li>
  <li>Set a card</li>
  <li>Perform a Special Summon that does not start a Chain (including Xyz Summon, Synchro Summon)</li>
  <li>Change a monster's Battle Position</li>
  <li>Attempt to move to the next Phase/Step</li>
  <li>Draw a card for your normal draw during the Draw Phase</li>
  <li>Declare an attack</li>
  <li>Activate an Ignition Effect</li>
  <li>Activate a Spell Speed 1 Spell Card</li>
</ul>

<p>If the game state is "open", the turn player may perform any of the above actions that is appropriate. They can also choose to activate a fast effect, if they wish.</p>

<p>Whenever either player performs an action, the game state is no longer open, but <strong>"closed"</strong>. If the game state is "closed", then only fast effects can be activated, dependent on Fast Effect Timing rules.</p>

<p>When nothing is going on, and neither player wishes to do anything, the game state goes back to being "open". Technically, this means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IF the Turn Player has the chance to activate the next fast effect</li>
  <li>AND the turn player passes to the opponent</li>
  <li>AND the opponent then passes back</li>
  <li>AND no Chain is currently being formed then the game state is open again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to the Next Phase or Step</h3>

<p>If the game state is open, and the turn player chooses not to do anything, and the opponent waives the chance to activate a fast effect, and both players agree to have the turn proceed, then you move to the next Phase or Step.</p>

<h3>Turn Player's Priority</h3>
<p>The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect</li>
  <li>Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you're passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of play, announcing the end of your phases or steps implies giving up Priority. Therefore, when announcing the end of a phase, your opponent can just say "Before the end of your phase, I activate this card" and use a card.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The turn player starts with Priority to activate a card or effect first</li>
  <li>After a card's activation, and at the end of each phase or step, Priority passes to the opponent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simultaneous Effects</h3>
<h4>Perform actions simultaneously</h4>
<p>For cases like "Each player targets 1 monster," where both players resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect first. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the other player makes theirs.</p>

<h4>Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain (SEGOC)</h4>
<p>
  If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player's mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<p>If there are 2 or more effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. If the turn player has a mandatory quick effect, it is placed in the Chain immediately as the next Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Afterwards, the turn player adds their optional effects in any order<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    And finally the opponent adds their optional effects in any order<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
