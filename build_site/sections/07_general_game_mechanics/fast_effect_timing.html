<h2>Fast effect timing</h2>

<p>Fast effects are card activations and effects with a Spell Speed of 2 or higher, including monster Quick Effects, Quick-Play Spell Cards, and Trap Cards (which includes both activating Trap Cards, and activating the effects of things like Continuous Trap Cards).</p>

<p>Fast effects can be activated by either player - even during their opponent's turn, as long as the conditions are appropriate. When both players want to activate fast effects at the same time, they are placed on a Chain.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it can make a big difference WHO places their fast effect on the Chain first: this can determine who "goes next".</p>
<ul>
  <li>Usually, the turn player has the chance to "go next" and activate the next fast effect.</li>
  <li>However, during a Chain, the chance to go next passes back and forth between players.</li>
  <li>Also, if the turn player doesn't wish to take any actions, and instead wants to move along in the turn (for example, to the next Step or Phase), the opponent has an opportunity to go next, and activate a fast effect, before the turn proceeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the <a href="#fast_effect_timing_flowchart">chart</a> to see which player can "go next" regarding fast effects.</p>

<h3>Game state and Turn Player Actions</h3>

<p>Each Phase and Step starts with the turn player in box A of the chart listed below. This is when the game state is <strong>"open"</strong>, meaning the turn player has complete freedom of action.</p>

<p>Many actions can ONLY be performed when the game state is open (when you're in box A). Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal Summon (including Tribute Summon)</li>
  <li>Set a card</li>
  <li>Perform a Special Summon that does not start a Chain (including Xyz Summon, Synchro Summon)</li>
  <li>Change a monster's Battle Position</li>
  <li>Attempt to move to the next Phase/Step</li>
  <li>Draw a card for your normal draw during the Draw Phase</li>
  <li>Declare an attack</li>
  <li>Activate an Ignition Effect</li>
  <li>Activate a Spell Speed 1 Spell Card</li>
</ul>

<p>If the game state is "open", the turn player may perform any of the above actions that is appropriate. They can also choose to activate a fast effect, if they wish.</p>

<p>Whenever either player performs an action, the game state is no longer open, but <strong>"closed"</strong>. If the game state is "closed", then only fast effects can be activated, dependent on Fast Effect Timing rules.</p>

<p>When nothing is going on, and neither player wishes to do anything, the game state goes back to being "open". Technically, this means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IF the Turn Player has the chance to activate the next fast effect</li>
  <li>AND the turn player passes to the opponent</li>
  <li>AND the opponent then passes back</li>
  <li>AND no Chain is currently being formed then the game state is open again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to the Next Phase or Step</h3>

<p>If the game state is open, and the turn player chooses not to do anything, and the opponent waives the chance to activate a fast effect, and both players agree to have the turn proceed, then you move to the next Phase or Step.</p>

<h3>Turn Player's Priority</h3>
<p>The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect</li>
  <li>Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you're passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of play, announcing the end of your phases or steps implies giving up Priority. Therefore, when announcing the end of a phase, your opponent can just say "Before the end of your phase, I activate this card" and use a card.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The turn player starts with Priority to activate a card or effect first</li>
  <li>After a card's activation, and at the end of each phase or step, Priority passes to the opponent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simultaneous Effects</h3>
<h4>Perform actions simultaneously</h4>
<p>For cases like "Each player targets 1 monster," where both players resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect first. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the other player makes theirs.</p>

<h4>Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain (SEGOC)</h4>
<p>If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player's mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1.</p>
<p>If there are 2 or more effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order.</li>
  <li>Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order.</li>
  <li>Afterwards, the turn player adds their optional effects in any order.</li>
  <li>And finally the opponent adds their optional effects in any order.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mandatory Quick Effects and SEGOC</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    You Tribute Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="47297616">"Light and Darkness Dragon"</span> by Tributing your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26202165">"Sangan"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span>. The effects of both <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26202165">"Sangan"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> are mandatory to activate. If both of them are owned by the same player, they are placed on the Chain as Chain Link 1 and Chain Link 2, in any order. Afterwards, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="47297616">"Light and Darkness Dragon"</span>'s effect is activated as Chain Link 3. The activation of Chain Link 2 will then be negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="47297616">"Light and Darkness Dragon"</span>'s effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18144507">"Harpie's Feather Duster"</span>, and your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67227834">"Magic Formula"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65169794">"Black Pendant"</span> are destroyed. At this time, your opponent activates the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65169794">"Black Pendant"</span> that inflicts 500 damage as Chain Link 1, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67227834">"Magic Formula"</span> that increases their Life Points by 1000 as Chain Link 2. In this case, you can activate the effect of a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64184058">"Destiny HERO - Decider"</span> in your Graveyard that adds it to your hand and reduces the effect damage to 0. In this case, its effect becomes Chain Link 3. However, since the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64184058">"Destiny HERO - Decider"</span> was not activated directly on the Chain after the effect that inflicts damage, although it will still be added to your hand, the damage from the activated effect is not reduced to 0 (in this case, you will take damage from the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65169794">"Black Pendant"</span> normally)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

<h3>If vs When: Effects that Meet Their Activation Requirements in the Middle of the Resolution of an Effect or Chain</h3>
<p>
  If the Trigger Effect of a monster, or the effects of Spell/Trap Cards that activate with a specific timing, meet their timing during the resolution of a card or a chain, whether they can activate or not varies depending on 3 cases if they say "activate", "if [...] you can" or "when [...] you can"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Effects that say "activate if/when [...]" must activate (mandatory effect). As a result, if a chain or another card effect is resolving at the particular timing in which they activate, they activate after those resolutions are over<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3954901">"Felgrand Dragon"</span> is Special Summoned by a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> activated in a chain to a Normal Spell Card, the effect of the Normal Spell Card resolves immediately after the Special Summon. Afterwards, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3954901">"Felgrand Dragon"</span> that says "Target 1 monster in your Graveyard; this card gains ATK equal to that monster’s Level x 200." activates mandatorily.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that say "if [...] you can" can be activated if their meet their activation requirements during the resolution of other cards. If an "if [...] you can" effect meets its activation timing during the resolution of an effect/chain, you can choose to activate them after all those effects/chains finish resolving<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="60681103">"Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand"</span> is Special Summoned by a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> activated in a chain to a Normal Spell Card, the effect of the Normal Spell Card resolves immediately after the Special Summon. Afterwards, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="60681103">"Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand"</span> that says "If this card is Special Summoned from the Graveyard: You can target 1 monster your opponent controls or in their Graveyard; banish it ..." can be activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that say "when [...] you can" (optional effect) can only be activated during that timing<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. They must activate their effects immediately when that something occurs. If they cannot, or something happens between the time the condition is met and the next time cards or effects can be activated, then you miss your chance to use them<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. Examples and scenarios:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95833645">"Magma Dragon"</span> is Special Summoned by a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> activated in a chain to a Normal Spell Card (the activated Trap is Chain Link 2 or higher), since the effect of the Normal Spell Card resolves immediately after the Special Summon, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95833645">"Magma Dragon"</span> that says "When this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 Wyrm-Type monster in your Graveyard, except "Magma Dragon"; Special Summon it in Defense Position, but its effects are negated." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        If monsters are Tributed (for a Tribute<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup> or Ritual<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> Summon) or sent to the Graveyard to meet a Special Summon monster's summoning requirements (including Fusion<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup
        >, Synchro, Link), the Special Summon of the monster is performed afterwards. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can [...]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >. Examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="46044841">"Gusto Falco"</span> is used as a Material for a Synchro Summon, that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="46044841">"Gusto Falco"</span> is sent to the Graveyard as a Material, but since the Special Summon of the Synchro Monster is performed afterwards, its effect that says "When this face-up card on the field is sent to the Graveyard, except by battle: You can Special Summon 1 "Gusto" monster from your Deck in face-down Defense Position." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14778250">"The Tricky"</span> (1) is Special Summoned by sending <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> (2) from the hand to the Graveyard, when the (2) is sent to the Graveyard to perform the Special Summon of (1), (2)'s effect that says "You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
            >.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Even if the effect of an activated card is negated, that effect is negated but its resolution is still treated as being performed so for example while the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51452091">"Royal Decree"</span> that says "Negate all other Trap Card effects on the field." is being applied, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is activated by discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> as a cost, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is negated, but since the timing is treated as that effect being resolved, the effect of the discarded <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> that says "When this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
