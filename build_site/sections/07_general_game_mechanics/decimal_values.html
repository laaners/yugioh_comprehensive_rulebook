<h2>Decimal Values</h2>
<p>
  If LP or ATK/DEF are halved by some effect, so that the result has decimal values, the calculation is rounded up.<br />
  Example: If you have 525 LP and you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> by paying half your LP, your remaining LP becomes 263.
