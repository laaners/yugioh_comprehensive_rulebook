<h2>Forbidden &amp; Limited Cards</h2>
<p>Normally, your Deck (including Extra Deck and Side Deck) can contain up to 3 copies of a card that has the same name. However, certain cards have specific quantity restrictions that further limit the number that can be included in a Deck. There are 3 types of restrictions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limited cards are restricted to 1 copy in a Deck</li>
  <li>Semi-Limited cards are restricted to 2 copies in a Deck</li>
  <li>Forbidden cards are not allowed to be included at all</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of Forbidden and Limited cards is updated regularly and is posted on the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Official Website. This list is applied to official tournaments so please check it before participating. Official Website: www.yugioh-card.com</p>
