      <u>Question:</u><br /><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span>' effect that destroys a targeted card was activated by Tributing itself.<br />If I chain the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75286621">"Invoked Mechaba"</span> in response, will that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span> be banished?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75286621">"Invoked Mechaba"</span> in response to the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span>, that effect's activation will be negated. However, whether <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span> will be banished or not depends on it remaining on the field until the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75286621">"Invoked Mechaba"</span> resolves.<br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span> is Tributed itself as a cost to activate its effect, the effect's activation will be negated due to the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75286621">"Invoked Mechaba"</span>. However, since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span> that activated the effect is no longer on the field, it will not be banished.<br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span> Tributed another "Dinowrestler" monster to activate its effect, and that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82385847">"Dinowrestler Pankratops"</span> is still on the field when the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75286621">"Invoked Mechaba"</span> resolves, it will be banished.
