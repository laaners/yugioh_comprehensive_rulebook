<h2>Control/Possess/Own</h2>
<p>
  The controller of a card is the player who is using that card <sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. For effects of cards, the player who activates that effect is the controller. When an effect resolves, "you/the opponent" is seen from the point of view of the controller of that effect <sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    Even if you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77558536">"Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"</span> that says " You can send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the GY" and the opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98045062">"Enemy Controller"</span> in a chain, taking control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77558536">"Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"</span>, it is you, the player who activated the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77558536">"Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"</span>, that resolves it.

  <li>
    Cards you "control" are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell &amp; Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards in your "possession" include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the field, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards you "own" are cards that you possessed at the start of the Duel. The card's owner is distinct from its possessor: while the controller of a card may change, its owner cannot. All cards in a player's Main Deck and Extra Deck at the start of the Duel (before drawing their opening hand) are considered to be owned by that player. Token Monsters are owned by the player who Special Summoned them. When a card is returned to the hand, Main Deck or Extra Deck, is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, it returns to its owner's possession<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller's side of the field. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
