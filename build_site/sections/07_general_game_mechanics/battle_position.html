<h2>Battle Position</h2>

<p>Aside from Link Monsters, cards in the Monster Zones are placed on the field in either face-up Attack Position, face-up Defense Position, or face-down Defense Position.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Link Monsters are always placed in face-up Attack Position in Monster Zones.</li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, if an effect that says "change the battle position" is applied, the battle position is changed to one of the following battle positions:
    <ul>
      <li>Face-up Attack Position ⇒ Face-up Defense Position</li>
      <li>Face-up Defense Position ⇒ Face-up Attack Position</li>
      <li>Face-down Defense Position ⇒ Face-up Attack Position (Flip Summon)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Face-up Attack Position</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Monsters in face-up Attack Position can perform attack declarations during the Battle Step of the Battle Phase.</li>
  <li>If a face-up Attack Position monster battles, the ATK value of that monster is used to perform damage calculation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Face-up Defense Position</h3>

<p>Monster Cards placed in a Monster Zone horizontally and face-up are in face-up Defense Position.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Face-up Defense Position monsters cannot perform attack declarations except in special occasions.</li>
  <li>If a face-up Defense Position monster battles, the DEF value of that monster is used to perform damage calculation.</li>

<h3>Face-down Defense Position</h3>

<p>Monsters placed on the field in a Monster Zone horizontally and face-down are in face-down Defense Position.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Monster Information of face-down Monsters like their card name/Level/Attribute/Type/Monster Type/Effect Text/etc. is private to the opponent. The controller of those cards can always verify face-down monsters.</li>
  <li>Face-down monsters are not affected by effects that change the card name, Type, Attribute, ATK/DEF, Level or Rank of monsters on the field.</li>
  <li>Face-down monsters cannot perform attack declarations.</li>
  <li>If a face-down Defense Position monster battles, it is changed to face-up Defense Position before damage calculation and the DEF value of that monster is used to perform damage calculation.</li>
  <li>
    If a monster that needs to meet particular requirements must be sent to the Graveyard/returned to the hand/returned to the Deck/etc. in order to activate or resolve an effect like "send 1 X-Type monster to the Graveyard;", face-down monsters cannot be chosen as it is not possible for both players to verify that those conditions are met. However, if monsters that need to meet particular requirements must be Tributed for a Tribute Summon or to activate/resolve an effect, the controller of those face-down monsters can Tribute them.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      A face-down Plant-Type monster cannot be sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95239444">"Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter"</span> that says "You can send 1 Plant-Type monster from your hand or face-up from your side of the field to the Graveyard;". However, a face-down monster can be Tributed as a cost to activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="91078716">"Pollinosis"</span> that says "Tribute 1 Plant-Type monster;".
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Face-down monsters cannot be affected by the effects of cards that must target a monster that meets particular requirements like "target 1 X-Type monster".
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      A face-down <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2732323">"Decoy Dragon"</span> cannot be targeted to activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20638610">"Dragon's Rebirth"</span> that says "Target 1 Dragon-Type monster you control;".

<h3>Changing the battle positions of monsters</h3>

<ul>

  <li>A monster that performed an attack declaration cannot have its battle position changed during that turn.</li>
  <li>
