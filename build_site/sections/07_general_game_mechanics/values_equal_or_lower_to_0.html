    <summary>Example</summary>
    If a 1000 ATK monster would have its ATK reduced by 1400 by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9012916">"Black-Winged Dragon"</span> that says "that target loses 700 ATK for each Black Feather Counter you removed, and if it does, inflict damage to your opponent equal to the ATK lost by this effect.", the ATK of that monster becomes 0 as a result, and 1000 damage is inflicted to the opponent as a result.
