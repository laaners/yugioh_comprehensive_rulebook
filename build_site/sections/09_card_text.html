<h1>Card text</h1>

<p>In most cases, card texts break down the requirements to resolve the effect like costs and the effect that is applied during the resolution.</p>

<p>Example: For <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41442341">"Puppet Master"</span>, "When this card is Tribute Summoned:" is the activation timing, "You can pay 2000 Life Points" is the activation cost, "2 Fiend-Type monsters in your Graveyard" are the targets, and "Special Summon those targets. They cannot attack this turn." is the effect resolution.</p>

<table align="center">

    <tr>
      <td>Timing: When this card is Tribute Summoned</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Special Summon those targets. They cannot attack this turn</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Cost: You can pay 2000 Life Points</td>
