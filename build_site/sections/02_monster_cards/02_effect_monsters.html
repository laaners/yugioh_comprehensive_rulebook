        An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities. The effects of these monsters are split into four categories:
        <ol>
          <li>Continuous Effect</li>
          <li>Ignition Effect</li>
          <li>Quick Effect</li>
          <li>Trigger Effect (including Flip)</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Continuous Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Example: "Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Ignition Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
        <br />
        <br />
        Example: "You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Quick Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These are special monster effects that you can activate even during your opponent's turn. These types of effects have a Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell Speed of 1.
        <br />
        <br />
        Example: "When an effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can target 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Trigger Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These effects are activated at specific times, such as "during the Standby Phase" or "when this monster is destroyed".
        <br />
        <br />
        Example: "When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: Target 1 card on the field; destroy that target."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Flip Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word "FLIP:" on the card.
        <br />
        <br />
        Example: "FLIP: Draw 1 card."

        These are Effect Monster Cards that have a Trigger Effect that activates upon being flipped face-up, which is called a Flip effect:
        <p>"FLIP: [...]"</p>
        A few exceptional Flip monsters do not have such an effect, but instead have other effects that apply after being flipped face-up.

  <li>
    If the effect that says "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard" is being applied, that monster is treated as a Normal Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    A Gemini monster that is Summoned again and gains effects is treated as an Effect Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    If a Gemini monster is Summoned again by being equipped with an Equip Card or by an effect applied on the field, it remains Summoned once again as long as that Equip Card is not destroyed and remains equipped or as long as the effect keeps applying<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
