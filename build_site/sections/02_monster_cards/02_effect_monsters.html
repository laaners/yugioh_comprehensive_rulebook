        An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities. The effects of these monsters are split into four categories:
        <ol>
          <li>Continuous Effect</li>
          <li>Ignition Effect</li>
          <li>Quick Effect</li>
          <li>Trigger Effect (including Flip)</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Continuous Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Ignition Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Quick Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These are special monster effects that you can activate even during your opponent's turn. These types of effects have a Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell Speed of 1.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "When an effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can target 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Trigger Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These effects are activated at specific times, such as "during the Standby Phase" or "when this monster is destroyed".
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: Target 1 card on the field; destroy that target."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Flip Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word "FLIP:" on the card.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "FLIP: Draw 1 card."
      </td>

<h3>Continuous Effects</h3>

<p>The effects of monsters that are applied and keep applying as long as that monster is face-up in a Monster Zone are Continuous Effects. There are also Continuous Effects that have necessary conditions to be applied.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Continuous effects do not start a chain and start applying the moment the monster is face-up.<br />
    Example: Since the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> (1) that says "While this Special Summoned card is on the field, all Fairy-Type monsters you control gain 500 ATK and DEF." is applied immediately, the ATK of (1) is 1700 when it is successfully Normal Summoned. As a result, a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29401950">"Bottomless Trap Hole"</span> that says "When your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK:" can be activated when the Normal Summon of (1) is successful.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster stops being face-up, leaves the field, or is determined to be destroyed, the effect stops being applied immediately. Even if the monster stops being face-up during the resolution of an effect, the effect stops applying at that moment.
    <br />
    Example: While you control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> (1) and the opponent controls a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> (2), if (1) is destroyed, since its Continuous Effect that says "Negate the effects of face-up monsters on the field that were Special Summoned from the Extra Deck." stops applying immediately, the Continuous Effect of (2) that says "Any card sent to your opponent's Graveyard is banished instead." is applied and (1) is banished. If (1) and (2) are destroyed simultaneously by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span> or something similar, since neither effect is applied, they are not banished and are sent to the Graveyard after being destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>If that monster is destroyed by battle, the effect stops applying when that monster is determined to be destroyed during damage calculation.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Ignition Effects</h3>

<p>Effects that can be declared to activate during the Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect, are Ignition Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ignition Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>There are also Ignition Effects that activate outside of the field, like in the Graveyard or hand.</li>
  <li>Ignition Effects have a Spell Speed of 1.</li>
  <li>If an Ignition Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Quick Effects</h3>

<p>Effects that can be activated when you have priority during the opponent's turn, providing a particular timing, are Quick Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Quick Effects have a Spell Speed of 2. They can also be activated in a chain to the activation of cards or effects.</li>
  <li>
    Quick Effects are classified in the following groups in most cases.
    <ul>
      <li>Effects that say "can also be activated during the opponent's turn", which can be activated arbitrarily during the opponent's turn.</li>
      <li>Effects that negate the activations of cards or effects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a Quick Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Quick Effects cannot be activated during the Damage Step. However, effects that negate the activations of cards or effects, or that increase or decrease the ATK/DEF of monsters, can be activated. Effects that increase or decrease the ATK/DEF of monsters can be activated only before damage calculation.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Trigger Effects</h3>

<p>Effects that are activated in a particular written timing are Trigger Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trigger Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects have a Spell Speed of 1. However, if multiple Trigger Effects activate at the same timing, they form a chain.</li>

  <li>Since multiple effects that activate during a particular phase like the Standby Phase or End Phase are not treated as activating simultaneously, after activating and resolving 1 effect, other Trigger Effects can be activated and resolved.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Trigger Effects do not activate if they meet their timing during the Damage Step. However, Trigger Effects that: activate mandatorily; activate when the monster itself is Special Summoned successfully; effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up; and effects that activate when the monster is destroyed, banished, or added to the hand, can be activated.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up activate in most cases when that monster is changed from being face-down to face-up on the field. When monsters with Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up are attacked and flipped face-up, the effects activate during the timing of "after damage calculation" of that battle.</li>
  <li>If a Trigger Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Activation Location</h4>

<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has been moved to a private location like the Deck or hand, the Trigger Effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.<br />
  Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> (1) is activated discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> (2) for the cost, and (2) is returned to the hand by the effect of that (1) that says "add it to your hand.", the effect of (2) that activates "If this card is sent to the Graveyard:" does not activate.
</p>

<p>
  If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location (On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck) changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.

<h4>Multiple Hand Summon Triggers</h4>

<p>
  If you have multiple monsters in your hand with Trigger Effects to Special Summon themselves (that activate in the hand in a particular timing), their effects cannot be activated in a chain and only 1 of them can be activated.<br />
  Example: When you take battle damage while you have 2 copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span>, only the effect of 1 copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span> that says "When you take damage from a card in your opponent's possession:" can be activated.

</ol>

<h3>Other Effects</h3>

<p>Effects that do not belong to the Continuous Effect, Ignition Effect, Trigger Effect or Quick Effect categories are effects that do not belong to any category.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Those other effects are Monster Effects. As a result, if they are applied on the field they are negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> in most cases.</li>
  <li>Those other effects do not activate or start a chain. They are applied as conditions are met. Even if the conditions are met in the middle of the resolution of an effect, the effect is applied at that moment.</li>
  <li>
    The following effects are some examples of those other effects.
    <ul>
      <li>Effects of monsters that are not Special Summon Monsters that Special Summon themselves from the hand or Graveyard without activating.</li>
      <li>Monster Effects that keep applying while that monster is in the Graveyard or while they are face-down.</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this card would leave the field, banish it instead".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this card is Normal Summoned without Tributing, or is Special Summoned, its original ATK becomes [...].".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this face-up card is destroyed while it is in a Monster Card Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Card Zone as a Continuous Spell Card, instead of sending it to the Graveyard.".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can Set this card from your hand to your Spell & Trap Zone as a Spell Card.".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can only control 1 "[...]"".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "An Xyz Monster that was Summoned using [...] as Xyz Material gains this effect.".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
