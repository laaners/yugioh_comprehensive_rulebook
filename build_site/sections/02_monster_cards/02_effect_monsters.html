        An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities. The effects of these monsters are split into four categories:
        <ol>
          <li>Continuous Effect</li>
          <li>Ignition Effect</li>
          <li>Quick Effect</li>
          <li>Trigger Effect (including Flip)</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Continuous Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Ignition Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Quick Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These are special monster effects that you can activate even during your opponent's turn. These types of effects have a Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell Speed of 1.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "When an effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can target 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Trigger Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        These effects are activated at specific times, such as "during the Standby Phase" or "when this monster is destroyed".
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: Target 1 card on the field; destroy that target."
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Flip Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word "FLIP:" on the card.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "FLIP: Draw 1 card."

<h3>Continuous Effects (and continuous Spell/Traps)</h3>
<p>
  The effects of monsters that are applied and keep applying as long as that monster is face-up in a Monster Zone are Continuous Effects. There are also Continuous Effects that have necessary conditions to be applied<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Continuous effects do not start a chain and start applying the moment the monster is face-up<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: Since the Continuous Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76990617">"Sonata the Melodious Diva"</span> (1) that says "While this Special Summoned card is on the field, all Fairy-Type monsters you control gain 500 ATK and DEF." is applied immediately, the ATK of (1) is 1700 when it is successfully Normal Summoned. As a result, a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29401950">"Bottomless Trap Hole"</span> that says "When your opponent Summons a monster(s) with 1500 or more ATK:" can be activated when the Normal Summon of (1) is successful.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster stops being face-up, leaves the field, or is determined to be destroyed, the effect stops being applied immediately. Even if the monster stops being face-up during the resolution of an effect, the effect stops applying at that moment<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: While you control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89463537">"Nekroz of Unicore"</span> (1) and the opponent controls a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58481572">"Masked HERO Dark Law"</span> (2), if (1) is destroyed, since its Continuous Effect that says "Negate the effects of face-up monsters on the field that were Special Summoned from the Extra Deck." stops applying immediately, the Continuous Effect of (2) that says "Any card sent to your opponent's Graveyard is banished instead." is applied and (1) is banished. If (1) and (2) are destroyed simultaneously by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span> or something similar, since neither effect is applied, they are not banished and are sent to the Graveyard after being destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that monster is destroyed by battle, the effect stops applying when that monster is determined to be destroyed during damage calculation<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continuous Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Continuous Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving</h4>
<p>
  Continuous Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving.<br />
  Example: you control a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>. If you control a non-"Infernoid" monster, you can active it. If you choose to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>'s effect that sends "Infernoid" monsters to the Graveyard as part of the card activation, before that effect begins resolving, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> will be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect. As a result, you will then be unable to send "Infernoid" monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard.

<h3>Ignition Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that can be declared to activate during the Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect, are Ignition Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ignition Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>There are also Ignition Effects that activate outside of the field, like in the Graveyard or hand.</li>
  <li>Ignition Effects have a Spell Speed of 1.</li>
  <li>If an Ignition Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Quick Effects</h3>

<p>Effects that can be activated when you have priority during the opponent's turn, providing a particular timing, are Quick Effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Quick Effects have a Spell Speed of 2. They can also be activated in a chain to the activation of cards or effects.</li>
  <li>
    Quick Effects are classified in the following groups in most cases.
    <ul>
      <li>Effects that say "can also be activated during the opponent's turn", which can be activated arbitrarily during the opponent's turn.</li>
      <li>Effects that negate the activations of cards or effects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a Quick Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Quick Effects cannot be activated during the Damage Step. However, effects that negate the activations of cards or effects, or that increase or decrease the ATK/DEF of monsters, can be activated. Effects that increase or decrease the ATK/DEF of monsters can be activated only before damage calculation.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Trigger Effects (and Spell/Traps triggers)</h3>

<p>Effects that are activated in a particular written timing are Trigger Effects. Spell and Trap Cards can also have effects that trigger.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trigger Effects start a chain when they activate.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects have a Spell Speed of 1. However, if multiple Trigger Effects activate at the same timing, they form a chain.</li>
  <li>Since multiple effects that activate during a particular phase like the Standby Phase or End Phase are not treated as activating simultaneously, after activating and resolving 1 effect, other Trigger Effects can be activated and resolved.</li>
  <li>In most cases, Trigger Effects do not activate if they meet their timing during the Damage Step. However, Trigger Effects that: activate mandatorily; activate when the monster itself is Special Summoned successfully; effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up; and effects that activate when the monster is destroyed, banished, or added to the hand, can be activated.</li>
  <li>Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up activate in most cases when that monster is changed from being face-down to face-up on the field. When monsters with Trigger Effects that activate when the monster is flipped face-up are attacked and flipped face-up, the effects activate during the timing of "after damage calculation" of that battle.</li>
  <li>If a Trigger Effect is activated, and the monster that activated the effect leaves the field or is otherwise moved to a different location, the effect resolves afterwards. However, if something like "This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect." is written, so that this condition must be met at the time of the activation and at the time of the resolution, the effect is not applied.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Activation Location</h4>
<p>
  If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, but hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", but its location (On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck) changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has been moved to a private location like the Deck or hand, the Trigger Effect does not activate<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74848038">"Monster Reincarnation"</span> (1) is activated discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> (2) for the cost, and (2) is returned to the hand by the effect of that (1) that says "add it to your hand.", the effect of (2) that activates "If this card is sent to the Graveyard:" does not activate.
  </li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h4>Multiple Hand Summon Triggers</h4>
<p>
  If you have multiple monsters in your hand with Trigger Effects to Special Summon themselves (that activate in the hand in a particular timing), their effects cannot be activated in a chain and only 1 of them can be activated.<br />
  Example: When you take battle damage while you have 2 copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span>, only the effect of 1 copy of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44330098">"Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"</span> that says "When you take damage from a card in your opponent's possession:" can be activated.

  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Changing card type prevents Trigger effects from activating</h4>
<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has changed card type like from monster becomes an equip card, the Trigger Effect does not activate.
  <br />
  Example: when my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span> (1) declares an attack, its effect is activated, and my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> in a chain by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> (2). When resolving the effect of (1), if I choose to equip the Special Summoned (2) to it, the Special Summoned (2) becomes an Equip Card, and is no longer a monster, so after the current chain resolves, its effect cannot be activated. (In this case, after the chain resolves, since the number of monsters on your opponent's side of the field changed, a replay will occur).

  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Changing phase and Trigger still activating</h4>
<p>
  Trigger Effects still activate even when the phase changed during/after the resolution of an effect.
  <br />
  Example: you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> by Tributing it, and that effect resolves: it becomes the End Phase. Regardless, after <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span>'s effect resolves, a trigger effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50554729">"Amorphage Infection"</span> can be activated.

</ol>

<h4>Spell/Trap Cards will not "see" trigger before the card activation has resolved</h4>
<p>
  Trigger effects of Spell/Trap Cards will not "see" their activation condition before the card activation has resolved.
  <br />
  Example: you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66399653">"Union Hangar"</span>, but then chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> and Special Summon a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65622692">"Y-Dragon Head"</span> from your Graveyard. In this scenario, although the LIGHT Machine-Type Union monster <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65622692">"Y-Dragon Head"</span> was Special Summoned, since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="66399653">"Union Hangar"</span> had not resolved on the field yet, you cannot activate its second effect afterward.

</ol>

<h4>Monsters changing control after their Trigger effect meets its activation condition, before that effect can be activated</h4>
<p>
  Monsters changing control after their Trigger effect meets its activation condition can activate their effects after they've changed control (in which case the player who took control of the monster activates it).
  <br />
  Example: you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span> in your Graveyard, banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> as a cost from your Graveyard and targeting your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span>. When resolving this effect, you gain control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> and you can activate the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> you gained control of due the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span>.

</ol>

<h4>Monsters with a certain property being Summoned, and then losing that property before Trigger effects are checked for</h4>
<p>Example: while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> is face-up on the field, Skill Drain is activated, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> resolves in response, Special Summoning Harpie Queen. At the time that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span>, its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". Afterwards, when the effect of Skill Drain applies, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is negated, and its name returns to being "Harpie Queen". Regardless, a "Harpie Lady" or "Harpie Lady Sisters" has been Special Summoned to the field, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> must be activated.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Other Effects</h3>
<p>Effects that do not belong to the Continuous Effect, Ignition Effect, Trigger Effect or Quick Effect categories are effects that do not belong to any category.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Those other effects are Monster Effects. As a result, if they are applied on the field they are negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> in most cases.</li>
  <li>Those other effects do not activate or start a chain. They are applied as conditions are met. Even if the conditions are met in the middle of the resolution of an effect, the effect is applied at that moment.</li>
  <li>
    The following effects are some examples of those other effects.
    <ul>
      <li>Effects of monsters that are not Special Summon Monsters that Special Summon themselves from the hand or Graveyard without activating.</li>
      <li>Monster Effects that keep applying while that monster is in the Graveyard or while they are face-down.</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this card would leave the field, banish it instead".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this card is Normal Summoned without Tributing, or is Special Summoned, its original ATK becomes [...].".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "If this face-up card is destroyed while it is in a Monster Card Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Card Zone as a Continuous Spell Card, instead of sending it to the Graveyard.".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can Set this card from your hand to your Spell & Trap Zone as a Spell Card.".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can only control 1 "[...]"".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster".</li>
      <li>Effects that say "An Xyz Monster that was Summoned using [...] as Xyz Material gains this effect.".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Abilities</h3>

<p>The text written to the right of the Type is that monster's Summoning Method and its Abilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If that monster has a particular Special Summoning method, that monster will have the corresponding "Fusion", "Ritual", "Synchro", "Xyz" or "Link" descriptor.</li>
  <li>If that monster has a particular Ability, that monster will have the corresponding "Flip", "Toon", "Spirit", "Union" or "Gemini" descriptor.</li>
  <li>Monsters that read "Tuner" or "Pendulum" belong to those Types of monsters.</li>
  <li>Monsters that read "Normal" are Normal Monsters</li>
  <li>Monsters that read "Effect" are Effect Monsters.</li>

        These are Effect Monster Cards that are treated as Normal Monsters with no usable effects when first placed on the field, but can gain usable effects if they are Normal Summoned while already face-up on the field:

          "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while [face-up on the field/in the GY/...]. While this card is a Normal Monster on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it become an Effect Monster with this effect.<br />

<ul>
  <li>
    "Normal Summon it to have it become an Effect Monster" means Normal Summoning a monster that exists on the field once again. This can only be performed once per turn including other Normal Summons during that turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the effect that says "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard" is being applied, that monster is treated as a Normal Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Level 5 or higher Gemini monster on the field is Normal Summoned once again, it is not necessary to Tribute monsters<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a Gemini monster on the field is Normal Summoned once again, cards that negate that Normal Summon can be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Gemini monster that has its Summon negated is not treated as being destroyed and sent to the Graveyard from the hand or field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Gemini monster that is Summoned again and gains effects is treated as an Effect Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster that has been Summoned again and is treated as an Effect Monster leaves the field, it is not treated as having been Summoned once again<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster is Summoned again by being equipped with an Equip Card or by an effect applied on the field, it remains Summoned once again as long as that Equip Card is not destroyed and remains equipped or as long as the effect keeps applying<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster treated as a Normal Monster has its effects negated, the effect that says "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard" is negated and it is treated as an Effect Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster treated as an Effect Monster has its effects negated, the effects after the "•" are negated and it is treated as an Effect Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster has its effects negated, it is treated as an Effect Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: A Gemini monster that is attacked and destroyed in battle by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53982768">"Dark Ruler Ha Des"</span> has its effects negated by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53982768">"Dark Ruler Ha Des"</span> that says "Negate the effects of monsters destroyed by battle with Fiend-Type monsters you control", and it is treated as an Effect Monster as long as it is in the Graveyard.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster has its effects negated, it also cannot be Normal Summoned again<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
