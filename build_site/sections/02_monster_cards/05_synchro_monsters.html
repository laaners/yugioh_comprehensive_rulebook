        Synchro Monsters are placed in the Extra Deck, separate from the Main Deck. You can Special Summon a powerful Synchro Monster to the field in an instant just by using the Levels of your monsters. They can be Synchro Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 1 face-up "Tuner" monster and any number of face-up non-Tuner monsters from your field to the Graveyard, when the sum of all their Levels is exactly equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a Synchro Monster on the field or Graveyard or a Synchro Monster Card that is banished would be returned to the hand or Deck by a card effect, that monster is returned to the owner's Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
        <br />
        <br />
        After a properly Synchro Summoned Synchro Monster is sent to the Graveyard or banished, if it is Special Summoned from the Graveyard or from being Banished, it can be placed in any of your available Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup

        <b>Tuner Monsters</b>
        <br />
        In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster, you need 1 Tuner (look for "Tuner" next to its Type). The Tuner monster and other face-up monsters you use for the Synchro Summon are called Synchro Materials. The sum of their Levels is the Level of Synchro Monster you can Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Ability of being a Tuner is not treated as an effect<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tuners that have Monster Effects are Effect Monsters and Tuners that do not have effects written in their Monster Information are Normal Monsters. There are also Synchro Tuner Monsters<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

          <li>During your Main Phase, you can perform a Synchro Summon when the combined total Levels of 1 face-up Tuner monster and any number of other face-up monsters you control are equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster you want to Synchro Summon.</li>
          <li>After double-checking the Level of the Synchro Monster you want, send the face-up Synchro Materials from your field to the Graveyard (face-up means that face-down monsters cannot be used).</li>
          <li>After sending the Synchro Materials from the field to the Graveyard, take the Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck and play it either in the Extra Monster Zone or in any of your Main Monster Zones of in face-up Attack or Defense Position.</li>
        </ol>
        If the non-Tuner monsters need to meet certain requirements, all non-Tuner materials must meet those requirements<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup

<h3>Synchro Materials</h3>

<p>Monsters sent to the Graveyard for a Synchro Summon are Synchro Materials.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Synchro Materials are sent to the Graveyard before the Synchro Monster is placed on the field. Even if the Synchro Summon is negated, the monsters that became Synchro Materials are still sent to the Graveyard. However, in that case, those monsters are not treated as Synchro Materials.</li>
  <li>Even if an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, so that monsters sent to the Graveyard are banished, you can still Synchro Summon. In that case, the monsters used as Materials are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead.</li>
  <li>Token Monsters can also be used as Synchro Materials. In that case, the Token Monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel.</li>
  <li>Since Xyz and Link Monsters do not have a Level, they cannot be used as Synchro Materials.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be used as Synchro Materials. In that case, the Trap Cards used as Materials are sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>
    If Synchro Materials are Special Summoned to the field or are otherwise temporarily moved to a different location, they are no longer treated as Synchro Materials.
