        Pendulum Monster Cards are a unique kind of card that can be Summoned as monsters to attack or defend, or can be activated as Spell Cards in your Pendulum Zones to activate extra special abilities and allow you to Pendulum Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

        Whenever one of your Pendulum Monster Cards on the field (regardless of which Zone it is in, or even if it is a monster or not) would be sent to the Graveyard, place it face-up on your Extra Deck instead. You can Pendulum Summon it back to the field later! Monsters Pendulum Summoned from the Extra Deck must be Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone or your Main Monster Zone pointed to by a Link Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >. <br /><br />
        Pendulum Monsters that have Monster Effects are Effect Monsters, and Pendulum Monsters that do not have Monster Effects written in their Monster Information are Normal Monsters. Even if Pendulum Monsters that do not have a Monster Effect have a Pendulum Effect, they are treated as Normal Monsters<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

          <li>During your Main Phase, activate Pendulum Monster Cards as Spell Cards in your leftmost and rightmost Spell &amp; Trap Zones. These Spell &amp; Trap Zones also become Pendulum Zones.</li>
          <li>After you have one in each Pendulum Zone, once per turn during your Main Phase, declare that you're Pendulum Summoning.</li>
          <li>Check the Pendulum Scales on the sides of your 2 Pendulum Monster Cards, then Special Summon as many monsters as you want from your hand and as many face-up Pendulum Monsters from your Extra Deck, whose Levels are in between those Pendulum Scales.</li>
        </ol>
        Pendulum Monsters that would be Pendulum Summoned from the Extra Deck must be Special Summoned in the Extra Monster Zone or in your available Main Monster Zones that are pointed by a Link Arrow. If you do not have an available Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone that is pointed by a Link Arrow, you can only Pendulum Summon monsters from the hand<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

        Pendulum Summons can only be performed once per turn<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

        <br />
        <br />
        If the Pendulum Summon is negated, all monsters that would have been Special Summoned are sent to the Graveyard. In that case, they are not treated as being sent from the hand, field, or Extra Deck to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

Providing 1 monster is Pendulum Summoned, the Pendulum Summon can be negated by activating the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="71564252">"Thunder King Rai-Oh"</span>.</li>

<h3>Pendulum Monsters treated as Spell Cards</h3>

<p>Pendulum Monsters activated in a Pendulum Zone or that are placed in the Pendulum Zone by an effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone are treated as Spell Cards.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pendulum Effects can only be activated or applied while placed in the Pendulum Zone.</li>
  <li>Pendulum Effects are treated as the effects of Spell Cards.</li>
  <li>Pendulum Monsters treated as Spell Cards in the Pendulum Zone are not treated as Normal, Continuous, Field, Equip, Quick-Play or Ritual Spells.</li>
  <li>Activating a Pendulum Monster in a Pendulum Zone is treated as the activation of a Spell Card. As a result, the activation can be negated by effects that negate the activations of Spell Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77414722">"Magic Jammer"</span>. If a Pendulum Monster has its activation as a Spell Card negated, that Pendulum Monster is sent to the Graveyard normally, providing no particular effect is being applied.</li>
  <li>Activating a Pendulum Monster in a Pendulum Zone is only treated as the activation of a Spell Card, and its effects cannot be activated at that time.</li>
  <li>Pendulum Monsters cannot be Set face-down in a Pendulum Zone.</li>
  <li>Among Pendulum Effects, there are effects that are applied while they exist in a Pendulum Zone, and there are effects that can be activated when certain requirements are met. In that case, they are treated as activating the effect of a card and not as the activation of a Spell Card.</li>
  <li>Pendulum Effects that activate are of Spell Speed 1. As a result, they cannot be activated in a chain to the activation of cards or effects.</li>
  <li>Pendulum Effects are invalidated immediately when they leave the field. Also, if a Pendulum Effect is activated, and that Pendulum Monster is destroyed by a card effect activated in a chain, the Pendulum Effect does not resolve.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Negate Activation of Cards</h3>
<p>If Pendulum Monsters are placed in the Pendulum Zone, this is treated as the activation of a Spell Card. If their activation is negated by the effect of a card that negates the activation of Spells, since they are not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard, they are sent to the Graveyard like any other card</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Negate Summons (outside the field)</h3>
<p>Pendulum Monsters sent from outside the field to the Graveyard are sent to the Graveyard normally. For example, if at the time you would Normal Summon a Pendulum Monster from the hand that itself is negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span>, the Pendulum Monster that is not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard is not added to the Extra Deck, and is sent to the Graveyard.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Banish instead of sending to the Graveyard</h3>
<p>If an effect that says "Any monster sent to the Graveyard is banished instead." is being applied when a Pendulum Monster placed in the Pendulum Zone is destroyed, since it exists on the field as a Spell Card, it is not banished and it is added to the Extra Deck</p>

<p>If an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, so that (all kinds of) cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, the effect text takes precedence and Pendulum Monsters are not added to the Extra Deck and are banished instead.</p>

<h3>Pendulum Monsters as Xyz Material</h3>
<p>A monster treated as an Xyz Material is not treated as a card on the field. The same applies to Pendulum Monsters treated as Xyz Materials. Therefore, if a Pendulum Monster treated as an Xyz Material is detached, since this is not treated as sending a card from the field to the Graveyard, that Pendulum Monster is sent to the Graveyard.</p>
