          <li>Finally, place your Summoning card in the Graveyard. (If another card effect causes your Fusion Materials to be sent to a place other than the Graveyard when your Summoning card resolves, send them to that other place, but the Fusion Summon still happens anyway).</li>

<h3>Fusion Materials</h3>

<p>
  The monsters sent to the Graveyard for a Fusion Summon during the resolution of the card that performs a Fusion Summon are Fusion Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you use monsters on your side of the field as Fusion Materials, you can also use face-down monsters<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fusion Materials are sent to the Graveyard during the resolution of the effect of the card that performs a Fusion Summon. If the activation of that card is negated, since that card does not resolve afterwards, the Fusion Materials are not sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, the monsters that can be Fusion Materials are only monsters in your possession<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, so that monsters that are sent to the Graveyard are banished, a card that performs a Fusion Summon can be activated and Fusion Summon. In that case, the monsters used as Materials are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Token Monsters on the field can also be used as Fusion Materials. In that case, the Tokens are not sent to the Graveyard and they are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Link Monsters can also be used as Fusion Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be used as Fusion Materials. In that case, the Trap Cards used as Materials are sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Fusion Materials for the Fusion Summon are sent to the Graveyard by an effect, but afterwards the Fusion Summon is performed. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can do [effect]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fusion Materials that are Special Summoned to the field or are otherwise moved to a different location temporarily are no longer treated as Fusion Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If an <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79979666">"Elemental HERO Bubbleman"</span> sent to the Graveyard as a Fusion Material is Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83764718">"Monster Reborn"</span> or something similar, and later it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard again, it cannot be Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95286165">"De-Fusion"</span>.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Fusion Monster is destroyed or is otherwise moved to a different location, the Fusion Materials that were used for that monster are not treated as being Fusion Materials for that monster. However, effects that temporarily banish the monster like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36261276">"Interdimensional Matter Transporter"</span> are an exception<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<h3>You do not use Polymerization</h3>
<p>
  Fusion Monsters that say "you do not use Polymerization" in their Effect Text cannot be Fusion Summoned by cards that perform a Fusion Summon. They can be Special Summoned by the method they list<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Some recently released cards have also started to omit "you do not use Polymerization", listing only the summoning procedures such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65815684">"Vicious Astraloud"</span>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Since no card is activated, this does not start a chain<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Special Summoning by this method is not treated as a Fusion Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27581098">"Non-Fusion Area"</span>'s "neither player can Fusion Summon" effect is applying, can I Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79229522">"Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"</span> using the listed procedure?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If you Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79229522">"Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"</span> using the listed procedure, this is not a Fusion Summon. Therefore, you can perform this Special Summon even while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27581098">"Non-Fusion Area"</span>'s effect is applying.

      <u>Question:</u><br />I have resolved the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5370235">"Cyberdark Chimera"</span>, and cannot use any monsters as Fusion Material this turn, except Dragon and Machine "Cyber" monsters.<br />In this situation, can I Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span> by Tributing a Level 10 or lower "Cyberdark" Fusion Monster equipped with "<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="1546123">"Cyber End Dragon"</span>"?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Even in this case, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span> can be Summoned using the listed procedure.<br />Note that, while this Special Summon is not a Fusion Summon, the Level 10 or lower "Cyberdark" Fusion Monster that is Tributed to attempt the Summon is treated as Fusion Material. Therefore, this monster's Type must be Dragon or Machine.<br />(If the monster's Type is not Dragon or Machine due to a card effect, you cannot Tribute that monster to Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span>.)
      <hr />
    </details>
    <b>ATTENTION</b>: monsters used for Fusion Monsters' procedure are still Fusion Materials, but they are <b>not materials for a Fusion Summon</b><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />If a monster cannot be used as material for a Fusion Summon due to the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58655504">"Gnomaterial"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62777823">"CONTAIN!"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14478717">"Libromancer Prevented"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11429811">"Warning Point"</span>, or similar, can I send that monster to the Graveyard to Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79229522">"Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"</span> using its listed procedure?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, these monsters can still be sent to the Graveyard for the Special Summon.<br />Special Summoning <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79229522">"Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"</span> using the listed procedure is not a Fusion Summon. Thus, the monsters used are also not treated as materials for a Fusion Summon. (However, they are still treated as Fusion Materials.)

    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Special Summoning without using <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="24094653">"Polymerization"</span> and Special Summoning Fusion Monsters by meeting requirements are not Special Summons as a result of the resolution of an effect. As a result, those Special Summons can be negated by cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span><sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Face-down monsters on the field can also be used for this Special Summon, like for a normal Fusion Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.

<h3>Must first be Fusion Summoned</h3>
<p>Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94977269">"El Shaddoll Winda"</span> that say "Must first be Fusion Summoned." mean that they can only be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by a Fusion Summon, and providing they have been Special Summoned properly, they can be Special Summoned by other card effects from the Graveyard.</p>

<p>Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84058253">"Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"</span> that say "A Fusion Summon of this card can only be done with the above Fusion Material Monsters." mean that if they are Fusion Summoned using a card that performs a Fusion Summon, you must use the appropriate materials listed in the text. Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53493204">"Goddess with the Third Eye"</span> that have an effect that says "You can substitute this card for any 1 Fusion Material Monster" cannot be used as a Material.</p>
