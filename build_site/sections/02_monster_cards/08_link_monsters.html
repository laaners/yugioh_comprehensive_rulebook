        A Link Monster are monsters with the ability to increase the number of monsters you can Summon from your Extra Deck for other Link monsters and Pendulum monsters. In addition to the 1 Extra Monster Zone you can usually use, you can also Summon Link and Pendulum monsters from the Extra Deck to any of your Main Monster Zones that has a Link Monster's red arrow pointing to it<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

        If 2 Extra Monster Zones are available, you can choose either one to Summon your monster. If there is a Link Monster already on the field, you can Link Summon a monster in one of your Zones it points to<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

          <li>Check the materials of the Link Monster you want to Summon.</li>
          <li>During your Main Phase, declare that you are Link Summoning, send a number of face-up monsters from your field to the Graveyard equal to the Link Rating of that Link Monster. They must also match the material requirements listed in the monster's "recipe" written on the card.</li>
          <li>Place the Link Monster from your Extra Deck in the Extra Monster Zone, or one of your Main Monster Zones that another Link Monster is pointing to.</li>
        </ol>
        Normally, 1 monster equals 1 Link Material. But when you use a Link Monster as material for another Link Summon, you can count it as either 1 monster, or as a number of monsters equal to its Link Rating. For example, if you want to Summon a Link 3 monster that requires 2 or more materials in its "recipe", you can either use 3 monsters (each counts as 1 material) or else a Link 2 Link Monster (counts as 1 or 2 materials) and a second monster (counts as 1 material)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

        <br />
        <br />
        After a properly Link Summoned Link Monster is sent to the Graveyard or banished, if it is Special Summoned from the Graveyard or from being Banished, it can be placed in any of your available Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

<h3>Defense</h3>
<p>Link Monsters have no DEF and cannot ever be in Defense Position. They can't be changed to Defense Position by a card effect. They can't even be flipped into face-down Defense Position.</p>

<h3>Special Summon to the Main Monster Zones</h3>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/link_main_monster.png" alt="link_main_monster" width="250" />
</div>
<p>Link and Pendulum Monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck normally have to go in the Extra Monster Zone. But Link Monsters open up more Zones for you to use, because every Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster points to can also be used to Summon Link and Pendulum monsters from your Extra Deck. Link and Pendulum Monsters that started in the Extra Deck, but later end up in the Graveyard (or are banished) and are Summoned from there, also go in the Main Monster Zones (and don't need a Link Monster to point to them).</p>

<h3>Link Materials</h3>

<p>
  Monsters sent to the Graveyard for a Link Summon are called Link Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Link Materials are sent to the Graveyard before the Link Monster is placed on the field. Even if the Link Summon is negated, the monsters that were sent to the Graveyard as Link Materials remain in the Graveyard. In that case, they are not treated as Link Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, it is possible to Link Summon even if the monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard would be banished. In that case, the monsters used as materials are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Token Monsters on the field can also be used as Link Materials. In that case, the Tokens are not sent to the Graveyard and they are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be used as Link Materials. In that case, the Trap Cards used as Materials are sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Link Materials are Special Summoned to the field or are otherwise temporarily moved to a different location, they are no longer treated as Link Materials<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Link Monster is destroyed or is otherwise moved to a different location, the Link Materials that were used for that monster are not treated as being Link Materials for that monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. However, effects that temporarily banish the monster like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36261276">"Interdimensional Matter Transporter"</span> are an exception<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>

<h3>Vocabulary</h3>

<p>Some common terms to know when dealing with Link Monsters:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Link Arrows</strong>: these are the big red triangles surrounding the picture of the monster. Only the red ones are Link Arrows.</li>
  <li><strong>Link Rating</strong>: the number in the lower right hand corner of a Link Monster where the DEF would normally be located. This is the number of Link Arrows the monster has, and also the number of Link Materials you need to use to Link Summon it.</li>
  <li><strong>Link Material</strong>: these are the face-up monsters on your side of the field that you use to Link Summon.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>points to</strong>: the Monster Zones and/or monsters that are directly adjacent to the tip of a Link Arrow are the zones and/or monsters that Link Monster "points to".
    <ul>
      <li>A <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="1861629">"Decode Talker"</span> placed in an Extra Monster Zone, for example, points to the Main Monster Zone directly above it, as well as the Main Monster Zones diagonally downwards to the left and right.</li>
      <li>A <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="1861629">"Decode Talker"</span> placed in the center Main Monster Zone does not point to anything, as there are no Monster Zones directly adjacent to the tip of its Link Arrows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>linked</strong>: a monster is "linked" if one or both of the following is true:
    <ol>
      <li>A Link Arrow is pointing to this monster.</li>
      <li>This monster is a Link Monster and one of its Link Arrows is pointing to another monster.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>co-linked</strong>: only Link Monsters can be "co-linked". Two Link Monsters are "co-linked" if they have Link Arrows that point at each other. In the following formation, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5043010">"Firewall Dragon"</span> is "co-linked" to 2 monsters: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98978921">"Link Spider"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34472920">"Honeybot"</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extra Link</h3>
<p>In addition to being linked or co-linked, there's a special type of "linked" state that a monster can be in: "Extra Linked". Only Link Monsters can be Extra Linked, and this state only occurs when a series of co-linked Link Monsters is built that connects a Link Monster in an Extra Monster Zone to a Link Monster in the other Extra Monster Zone. Each monster in the series must be co-linked to each other monster it is linked to in the series.</p>
<p>In the example below, we've placed a series of co-linked monsters from the right-hand Extra Monster Zone over to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone where the opponent has Link Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="1861629">"Decode Talker"</span>. Each of our Link Monsters is co-linked to each other Link Monster it's linked to in the series, so when we Link Summon the final monster in the series, each monster in the series becomes Extra Linked in addition to being co-linked and linked, including the opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="1861629">"Decode Talker"</span>. Any Link Monster that is co-linked to one of the monsters in this series is also Extra Linked, even if it's not contributing towards making the monsters Extra Linked. For example, an extra <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34472920">"Honeybot"</span> to the left or right of one of the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5043010">"Firewall Dragon"</span> would also be Extra Linked.</p>

<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/extra_link.png" alt="extra_link" width="500" />
</div>

<p>Under normal circumstances you cannot occupy both Extra Monster Zones with monsters from your Extra Deck. There is one, and only one, exception to this rule: If Link Summoning to the second Extra Monster Zone would create a complete series of Extra Linked Link Monsters, you may Link Summon a monster to that Extra Monster Zone to complete that series. So in the example below, you are allowed to Link Summon a monster to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone if and only if that monster would be co-linked to the left-hand <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5043010">"Firewall Dragon"</span>, causing all of the monsters to become Extra Linked.</p>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/extra_link_2.png" alt="extra_link_2" width="500" />
</div>

<p><strong>Link Monsters can be co-linked on diagonals</strong>, an Extra Link with only three monsters is then possible as well.</p>

<h3>Change/Take/Give/Switch Control</h3>
<p>If you take control of your opponent's monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone.</p>

<h3>Equip Cards and Activation Legality</h3>
<p>
  Equip Cards with impossible Continuous Effects can be activated. A Link Monster can be equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38552107">"Horn of Light"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span>. However, since Link Monsters do not have DEF, the effect of increasing DEF is not applied. In the case of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span> , the effect that negates other Spells' effects targeting the equipped monster and destroys them is applied normally.
