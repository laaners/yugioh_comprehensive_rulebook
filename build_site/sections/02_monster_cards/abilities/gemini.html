        These are Effect Monster Cards that are treated as Normal Monsters with no usable effects when first placed on the field, but can gain usable effects if they are Normal Summoned while already face-up on the field:
        <p>
          "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field/in the GY/... . While this card is a Normal Monster on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it become an Effect Monster with this effect.<br />

    "Normal Summon it to have it become an Effect Monster" means Normal Summoning a monster that exists on the field once again. This can only be performed once per turn including other Normal Summons during that turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. This action is still a Normal Summon<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56673480">"Contract with Don Thousand"</span> is face-up on your opponent's field, and its effect that reveals cards that are drawn while it is face-up is applying. If you are revealing a Spell Card in your hand due to that effect, so that you cannot Normal Summon/Set monsters, you cannot Normal Summon a Gemini monster treated as a Normal Monster to have it become an Effect Monster.

    If the effect that says "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard" is being applied, that monster is treated as a Normal Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    If a Level 5 or higher Gemini monster on the field is Normal Summoned once again, it is not necessary to Tribute monsters<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    A Gemini monster that is Summoned again and gains effects is treated as an Effect Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  <li>
    If a Gemini monster that has been Summoned again and is treated as an Effect Monster leaves the field, it is not treated as having been Summoned once again<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  </li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster is Summoned again by being equipped with an Equip Card or by an effect applied on the field, it remains Summoned once again as long as that Equip Card is not destroyed and remains equipped or as long as the effect keeps applying<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
