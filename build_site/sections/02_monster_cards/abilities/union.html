        These are Effect Monster Cards that have an effect that allows them to equip themselves to a monster as an Equip Card or unequip themselves to Special Summon themselves to a Monster Zone:
        <p>"Once per turn, you can either: Target 1 [X] monster you control; equip this card to that target, OR: Unequip this card and Special Summon it."</p>
