        Ritual Monsters are special monsters that are Special Summoned with a specific Ritual Spell Card, along with a required Tribute. Ritual Monster Cards are placed in the Main Deck and cannot be Summoned unless you have all the proper cards together in your hand or on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

          <li>When you have a Ritual Spell Card, along with the matching Ritual Monster Card, in your hand, along with the required Tribute (as listed on the Ritual Spell Card), you can activate the Ritual Spell Card, placing it in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone.</li>
          <li>If the activation of the Ritual Spell Card is successful, Tribute monsters by sending them from your hand or the field to the Graveyard. The Ritual Spell Card will list the required amount to Tribute.</li>
          <li>After sending the Tributed monsters to the Graveyard, play the Ritual Monster Card in your Main Monster Zone in either face-up Attack or Defense Position. Finally, place the Ritual Spell Card in the Graveyard.</li>

<h3>Tributes of a Ritual</h3>
<p>
  Tributes for a ritual are sent to the Graveyard as a result of the effect of the Ritual Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If monsters on the field are Tributed, face-down monsters can also be tributed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the activation of the Ritual Spell Card is negated, since the resolution is not performed, the Tributing is not performed either<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, you can only Tribute monsters in your possession<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Ritual Spell says "whose total Levels equal [X]", you must Tribute monsters so that the sum of the Level matches that value exactly. Also, if "whose total Levels equal [X] or more" is written, the sum does not need to be exactly equal as long as it is equal or more. <b>The number of Tributed monsters cannot be higher than necessary</b><sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30392583">"Prediction Ritual"</span> is activated and its effect that says "You must also Tribute monsters from your hand or field whose total Levels equal 9 or more" resolves, you cannot Tribute a Level 9 and a Level 2 monster, as the Levels already add up to 9 or more with only 1 monster. You can Tribute a Level 5 and a Level 6 monster.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens on the field can also be Tributed. In that case, Tokens that would be sent to the Graveyard are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters do not have a Level, they cannot be used for the tributes of a Ritual Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be tributed. In that case, the Tributed Trap Cards are sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Tributes for the Ritual Summon are Tributed by an effect, but afterwards the Ritual Summon is performed. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can do [effect]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Summoning the monster you tribute is not possible</h3>
<p>
  When activating a card (1) that has an effect that performs a Ritual Summon from the Graveyard for example, a valid Ritual Monster (2) must be present in the Graveyard. If you tribute a Ritual Monster (3) so that it meets the requirements to Summon (2) from the Graveyard, if (3) will be sent to the Graveyard as a result and (3) is also a valid target that can be Summoned with (1), you <strong>cannot</strong> Summon (3) from the Graveyard.

    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />Using the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97211663">"Nekroz Cycle"</span> that lets me Ritual Summon a "Nekroz" monster from the Graveyard, can I Tribute a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99185129">"Nekroz of Clausolas"</span> in my hand, then Ritual Summon that same <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99185129">"Nekroz of Clausolas"</span> that was sent to the Graveyard as a result?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />No, you cannot.<br />When you perform a Ritual Summon, you first select a Ritual Monster you want to Ritual Summon (in the case of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97211663">"Nekroz Cycle"</span>, a "Nekroz" Ritual Monster) in your hand or Graveyard. Then, you Tribute monsters from your hand and/or field so that their total Level exactly equals the Level of that monster, then perform the Ritual Summon.<br />Therefore, if you choose to Ritual Summon a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99185129">"Nekroz of Clausolas"</span> in your hand, you cannot Tribute that same <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99185129">"Nekroz of Clausolas"</span>. (You will need to Tribute other monsters from your hand and/or field to perform the Ritual Summon.)
