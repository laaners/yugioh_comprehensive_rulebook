        Xyz Monsters (pronounced "ikseez") can be Xyz Summoned whenever you control monsters that are the same Level. Xyz Monsters start in your Extra Deck and not in your Main Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.

        <img loading="lazy" src="./images/xyz_details.png" alt="xyz_details" width="350" />
        <br />
        When an Xyz Monster tells you to "detach" a material, take one of the stacked Xyz Material cards beneath your Xyz Monster and put it in the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
        <br />
        <br />
        If an Xyz Monster that is banished, on the field, or in the Graveyard would be returned to the hand or Deck by a card effect, that monster is returned to the owner's Extra Deck instead<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
        <br />
        <br />
        Xyz Monsters do not have a Level and have a Rank<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
        <br />
        <br />
        After a properly Xyz Summoned Xyz Monster is sent to the Graveyard or banished, if it is Special Summoned from the Graveyard or from being Banished, it can be placed in any of your available Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

<h3>Xyz Materials</h3>
<p>
  Monsters that are used to Xyz Summon are called "Xyz Materials", and are placed underneath the Xyz Monster, to show that they are attached to it<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Monsters that have become Xyz Materials are not treated as cards on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Xyz Summon is negated, the monsters that became Xyz Materials are sent to the Graveyard. Also, in that case, they are not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When an Xyz Monster leaves the field, all of the Xyz Materials attached to it are sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Xyz Materials are sent to the Graveyard, they are not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard. Also, the card is not treated as leaving the field<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33420078">"Plaguespreader Zombie"</span> Special Summoned by its own effect becomes an Xyz Material and is later sent to the Graveyard, since it is not treated as a card being sent from the field, the clause that says "banish it when it leaves the field" is not applied.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down, or becomes controlled by the opponent, the Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. They remain attached to the Xyz Monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Xyz Materials cannot be targeted for effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens cannot be used as Xyz Materials<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since Link Monsters do not have a Level or Rank, they cannot be used as Xyz Materials for an Xyz Summon<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be used as Xyz Materials.<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
