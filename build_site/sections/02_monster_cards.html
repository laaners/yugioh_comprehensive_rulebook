<h3>Card Name</h3>
<p>This is the card's name. When a card name is mentioned in card text it appears in quotations.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Level</h3>
<p>
  Count the number of stars here to find out the monster's Level. For Xyz Monsters, the number of stars is the Rank of the monster, and is on left<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters do not have a Level<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monsters that are not Xyz Monsters do not have a Rank<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Level/Rank of a monster is changed by a card effect, the Level/Rank of that card is only treated as the modified value. No single card is treated as having 2 or more Level/Ranks simultaneously. Also, the modified Level/Rank is not treated as the original Level/Rank<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Attribute</h3>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/attributes.png" alt="attributes" width="180" />
</div>

<p>
  Every monster has an Attribute. This Attribute is sometimes important for card effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If the Attribute is changed by another card effect, the card is only treated as having the modified Attribute<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card says "this card is also [X]-Attribute", its Attribute is treated as being of that Attribute by the card effect in addition to its original Attribute, as long as it remains face-up on the field. However, the appended Attribute is not treated as the original Attribute<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Type</h3>

<p>
  Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with specific abilities will have additional information here too, next to their Type<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The text that says [X]-Type on the top-left of the Monster Information is the Type of that monster<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Type changes by a card effect, the Type of that card is only treated as that Type. No single card is treated as having 2 or more Types simultaneously. Also, the modified Type is not treated as the original Type<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Card Number</h3>
<p>A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>

<h3>ATK (Attack Points)/DEF (Defense Points)</h3>
<p>
  ATK is a monster's Attack Points and DEF is a monster's Defense Points<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If an effect references "the original ATK or DEF", it references the values written in the card. However, if "the original ATK or DEF" is modified by a card effect, the modified value is treated as that card's original ATK or DEF<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the ATK or DEF of a monster outside the field is referenced, the written ATK or DEF in the card is referenced<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Link Monsters only have ATK, they do not have DEF<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Monsters with "?" values</h4>

<p>
  Monsters with "?" ATK or DEF values are monsters that modify those values by their own effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    When the values cannot be modified by their own effects, those values are treated as 0 when those monsters are on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a monster with "?" values is in the Deck or Graveyard, those values are treated as undefined and they cannot be chosen for effects that choose monsters that have a particular ATK or DEF<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26202165">"Sangan"</span>'s effect resolves, can I add a monster which has an indeterminate ATK value (with "?" written on the card) from the Deck to the hand?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You cannot add <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21208154">"The Wicked Avatar"</span>, or any other monster with an indeterminate ATK value of "?" written on the card, from your Deck to your hand using <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26202165">"Sangan"</span>'s effect.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    When a monster with "?" ATK is in the hand, its ATK is "?", so it is not treated as a monster with 0 ATK<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br /><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88305705">"Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"</span> is face-up on my field. In this situation, if my opponent activates the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98777036">"Tragoedia"</span> that Special Summons it from the hand when they take battle damage, is the effect negated?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88305705">"Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"</span> is applied, effects activated by monsters with 0 ATK are negated. While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98777036">"Tragoedia"</span> is in the hand, its ATK is "?", so it is not treated as a monster with 0 ATK. Therefore, the effect is not negated by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88305705">"Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"</span>, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98777036">"Tragoedia"</span> is Special Summoned from the hand normally.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    If an effect that doubles the ATK or DEF is applied on a monster with ? ATK, the original ATK value is treated as 0<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2948263">"Gogogo Golem - Golden Form"</span> that had its ATK become 4000 is targeted to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="55713623">"Shrink"</span>, since the original ATK of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2948263">"Gogogo Golem - Golden Form"</span> is ?, its ATK becomes 0.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Card Description</h3>

<p>Card effects are written here, describing the monster's special abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description of them written here that does not affect the game.</p>
