<h3>Card Name</h3>
<p>This is the card's name. When a card name is mentioned in card text it appears in quotations. If cards have the same name, they are considered to be the same card.</p>

<h3>Level</h3>
<p>
  Count the number of stars here to find out the monster's Level. For Xyz Monsters, the number of stars is the Rank of the monster, and is on left<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters do not have a Level<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monsters that are not Xyz Monsters do not have a Rank<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Level/Rank of a monster is changed by a card effect, the Level/Rank of that card is only treated as the modified value. No single card is treated as having 2 or more Level/Ranks simultaneously. Also, the modified Level/Rank is not treated as the original Level/Rank<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Attribute</h3>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/attributes.png" alt="attributes" width="180" />
</div>

<p>
  Every monster has an Attribute. This Attribute is sometimes important for card effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If the Attribute is changed by another card effect, the card is only treated as having the modified Attribute<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card says "this card is also [...]-Attribute", its Attribute is treated as being of that Attribute by the card effect in addition to its original Attribute, as long as it remains face-up on the field. However, the appended Attribute is not treated as the original Attribute<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Type</h3>

<p>
  Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with specific abilities will have additional information here too, next to their Type<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The text that says [...]-Type on the top-left of the Monster Information is the Type of that monster<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Type changes by a card effect, the Type of that card is only treated as that Type. No single card is treated as having 2 or more Types simultaneously. Also, the modified Type is not treated as the original Type<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Card Number</h3>
<p>A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>

<h3>ATK (Attack Points)/DEF (Defense Points)</h3>
<p>
  ATK is a monster's Attack Points and DEF is a monster's Defense Points<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If an effect references "the original ATK or DEF", it references the values written in the card. However, if "the original ATK or DEF" is modified by a card effect, the modified value is treated as that card's original ATK or DEF<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the ATK or DEF of a monster outside the field is referenced, the written ATK or DEF in the card is referenced<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Link Monsters only have ATK, they do not have DEF<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Monsters with "?" values</h4>

<p>Monsters with "?" ATK or DEF values are monsters that modify those values by their own effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    When the values cannot be modified by their own effects, those values are treated as 0 when those monsters are on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a monster with "?" values is in the Deck or Graveyard, those values are treated as undefined and they cannot be chosen for effects that choose monsters that have a particular ATK or DEF<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.<br />
    Example: A <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82971335">"Fortune Lady Earth"</span> with "?" ATK cannot be Special Summoned from the Deck with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97017120">"Giant Rat"</span> that reads "You can Special Summon 1 EARTH monster with 1500 or less ATK from your Deck, in Attack Position.".
  </li>
  <li>
    If an effect that doubles the ATK or DEF is applied on a monster with ? ATK, the original ATK value is treated as 0<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2948263">"Gogogo Golem - Golden Form"</span> that had its ATK become 4000 is targeted to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="55713623">"Shrink"</span>, since the original ATK of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2948263">"Gogogo Golem - Golden Form"</span> is ?, its ATK becomes 0.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Card Description</h3>

<p>Card effects are written here, describing the monster's special abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description of them written here that does not affect the game.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a simple slugfest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will not be enough. There are also monsters with strong special effects even though their ATK and DEF points are low. Therefore, your success in a Duel depends on how skillfully you can make use of the different kinds of cards.</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>

<p>The text written to the right of the Type is that monster's Summoning Method and its Abilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If that monster has a particular Special Summoning method, that monster will have the corresponding "Fusion", "Ritual", "Synchro", "Xyz" or "Link" descriptor.</li>
  <li>If that monster has a particular Ability, that monster will have the corresponding "Flip", "Toon", "Spirit", "Union" or "Gemini" descriptor.</li>
  <li>Monsters that read "Tuner" or "Pendulum" belong to those Types of monsters.</li>
  <li>Monsters that read "Normal" are Normal Monsters</li>
  <li>Monsters that read "Effect" are Effect Monsters.</li>
</ul>

        These are Effect Monster Cards that share these lines of text:
        <p>
          "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while [face-up on the field/in the GY/...]. While this card is a Normal Monster on the field, you can Normal Summon it to have it become an Effect Monster with this effect.<br />
          ‚óè [...]"
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>"Normal Summon it to have it become an Effect Monster" means Normal Summoning a monster that exists on the field once again. This can only be performed once per turn including other Normal Summons during that turn.</li>
  <li>If the effect that says "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard" is being applied, that monster is treated as a Normal Monster.</li>
  <li>If a Level 5 or higher Gemini monster on the field is Normal Summoned once again, it is not necessary to Tribute monsters.</li>
  <li>When a Gemini monster on the field is Normal Summoned once again, cards that negate that Normal Summon can be activated.</li>
  <li>A Gemini monster that has its Summon negated is not treated as being destroyed and sent to the Graveyard from the hand or field.</li>
  <li>A Gemini monster that is Summoned again and gains effects is treated as an Effect Monster.</li>
  <li>If a Gemini monster that has been Summoned again and is treated as an Effect Monster leaves the field, it is not treated as having been Summoned once again.</li>
  <li>If a Gemini monster is Summoned again by being equipped with an Equip Card or by an effect applied on the field, it remains Summoned once again as long as that Equip Card is not destroyed and remains equipped or as long as the effect keeps applying.</li>
  <li>If a Gemini monster treated as a Normal Monster has its effects negated, the effect that says "This card is treated as a Normal Monster while face-up on the field or in the Graveyard" is negated and it is treated as an Effect Monster.</li>
  <li>If a Gemini monster treated as an Effect Monster has its effects negated, the effects after the "‚Ä¢" are negated and it is treated as an Effect Monster.</li>
  <li>
    If a Gemini monster has its effects negated, it is treated as an Effect Monster.
    <br />
    Example: A Gemini monster that is attacked and destroyed in battle by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53982768">"Dark Ruler Ha Des"</span> has its effects negated by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53982768">"Dark Ruler Ha Des"</span> that says "Negate the effects of monsters destroyed by battle with Fiend-Type monsters you control", and it is treated as an Effect Monster as long as it is in the Graveyard.
