<h2>The Game Mat/Dueling Field</h2>
<p>The Game Mat helps you organize your cards during a Duel. When you use your cards you place them on the Game Mat. Different kinds of cards are placed in different Zones.</p>

<h3>The field</h3>
<p>If an effect says "the field", it refers one of the following locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main Monster Zones</li>
  <li>Extra Monster Zones</li>
  <li>Spell &amp; Trap Zones</li>
  <li>Pendulum Zones</li>
  <li>Field Zones</li>
</ul>
<p>If an effect simply says "card(s) on the field" without specifying yours or the opponent's, the effect can affect both player's Main Monster Zones, Extra Monster Zones, Spell &amp; Trap Zones, Field Zones and Pendulum Zones.</p>
<p>If an effect simply says "Monster Zones" without specifying Main or Extra Monster Zones, it affects both Main Monster Zones and Extra Monster Zones.</p>

</ol>

<h4>Main Monster Zone</h4>
<p>This is where you put your monsters when they're played.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can have up to 5 cards here.</li>
  <li>
    There are 3 ways to position your Monster Cards:
    <ol>
      <li>Face-up Attack Position</li>
      <li>Face-up Defense Position</li>
      <li>Face-down Defense Position</li>
    </ol>
    Place the card upright for Attack Position, and sideways for Defense Position.
  </li>
  <li>A monster placed in a Monster Zone cannot be moved to a different Monster Zone unless by an effect.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Extra Monster Zone</h4>
<p>This is where you put your monsters that are Summoned to the field by special methods from the Extra Deck</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normally, each player can only use 1 of these Zones. A monster placed in this Zone does not count towards the 5-monster limit of your Main Monster Zone.</li>
  <li>
    Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Monsters can be first Summoned from the Extra Deck to any of your Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. They do not have to be Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone or a spot that a Link Monster is pointing to. You can still Summon a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz Monster from the Extra Deck to your Extra Monster Zone if you want to, though.
  </li>
  <li>The restrictions requiring an Extra Monster Zone or Link Monster pointing still apply to Link Monsters and Pendulum Monsters that are Summoned from the Extra Deck.</li>
  <li>An Extra Monster Deck Zone in which no monster has been placed is not treated as either yours or the opponent's. Only if a monster is placed in a zone, that zone is treated as being a zone of the controller of that monster.</li>
  <li>Monsters that are not Special Summoned from the Extra Deck cannot be placed in the Extra Monster Zone.</li>
  <li>An Extra Monster Zone in which a monster has been placed is also treated as a Monster Zone of the controller of that monster.</li>
  <li>Monsters placed in the Extra Monster Zone cannot be moved to another zone unless an effect or resolution is applied.</li>
  <li>If a monster that has been Special Summoned from the Extra Deck into the Extra Monster Zone is later sent to the Graveyard or banished and later would be Special Summoned, it is not Special Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone and is Special Summoned into a Main Monster zone instead.</li>
  <li>The other Extra Monster Zone from the point of view of each Extra Monster Zone is not treated as "the adjacent zone".</li>
  <li>
    If control of a monster in the Extra Monster Zone changes
    <ul>
      <li>If control of a monster placed in an Extra Monster Zone switches to the other player's field, it is placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the player who gained control.</li>
      <li>If control of a monster that was transfered to the opponent from an Extra Monster Zone returns, it is not placed in the original Extra Monster Zone, and it is placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the player who regained control. If there is no available Main Monster Zone, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Spell &amp; Trap Zone</h4>
<p>This is where you put Spell &amp; Trap Cards.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can have up to 5 cards here.</li>
  <li>You place them here face-up to activate them, or place them face-down.</li>
  <li>A card placed in a Spell &amp; Trap Zone cannot be moved to a different Spell &amp; Trap Zone, unless by an effect.</li>
  <li>Since Field Spell Cards can only be placed in the Field Zone, they cannot be placed in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone.</li>
  <li>If a Monster Card is placed in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone by some effect or resolution, it is treated as a Spell or Trap Card (the effects will specify which kind of Spell or Trap).</li>
  <li>Pendulum Monster Cards can be activated in the leftmost and rightmost Zones as Spells. This causes the Zone you use to also become a Pendulum Zone for as long as the Pendulum Monster Card is there.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pendulum Zone</h4>
<p>This is the place where Pendulum Monsters activated as Spell Cards are placed in. The left-most and right-most of the 5 Spell &amp; Trap Zones on the field are also treated as Pendulum Zones. However, they are only treated as Pendulum Zones as long as there is a Pendulum Monster in them that has been activated from the hand as a Spell Card on that has been placed in them by an effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone. Furthermore, Pendulum Monsters placed here through these methods are treated as "cards in the Pendulum Zone(s)".</p>
<ul>
  <li>The only places in which Pendulum Monsters can be activated as Spell Cards from the hand or placed by an effect that places cards in a Pendulum Zone are the left-most and right-most of the 5 Spell &amp; Trap Zones on the field.</li>
  <li>New cards cannot be placed in a Pendulum Zone that already has a card placed on it.</li>
  <li>Pendulum Monsters placed in the Pendulum Zone are not treated as monsters and are treated as Spell Cards, as well as cards in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone. But they are still "Monster Cards".</li>
  <li>
    Only the Pendulum Monster cards that have been placed in a Pendulum Zone by being activated from the hand as Spell Cards or placed there by an effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone are treated as "cards in the Pendulum Zone".
    <ul>
      <li>For example: A Pendulum Monster treated as an Equip Card by an effect like the effect of Relinquished that says which is placed in a Pendulum Zone is not treated as "a card in the Pendulum Zone". Therefore, its Pendulum Effects cannot be used and a Pendulum Summon cannot be performed.</li>
      <li>Effects like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="31222701">"Wavering Eyes"</span> that "destroy all cards in the Pendulum Zones" cannot destroy Pendulum Monsters that have been placed in the Pendulum Zones by methods other than being activated from the hand as a Spell Card or by being placed there by a card effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone.</li>
      <li>If an Effect like the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33656832">"Acrobatic Magician"</span> which says "When this card is destroyed by battle: You can place this card in your Pendulum Zone" places a card from outside the Pendulum Zone into a Pendulum Zone, it can place a card in either the left-most or right-most of the 5 Spell &amp; Trap Zones that is available. If a card is placed by this method, that zone is also treated as a Pendulum Zone, and the card placed there is also treated as "a card in the Pendulum Zone".</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Field Zone</h4>
<p>Special Spell Cards called Field Spell Cards are played here (activated face-up or set face-down).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field.</li>
  <li>To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>
    Field Spell Cards do not count towards the 5-card limit of your Spell &amp; Trap Zone: they are not treated as cards in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12538374">"Treeborn Frog"</span> that can be activated if "You must control no Spell/Trap Cards to activate and to resolve this effect." cannot be activated if there is a Field Spell Card.</li>
      <li>The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="24731453">"Snow Plow Hustle Rustle"</span> that says "When your opponent's monster declares a direct attack, if you control a card(s) in your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone:" cannot be activated if the only Spell &amp; Trap Cards you control are in your Field Zone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3>Graveyard</h3>
<p>When Monster Cards are destroyed, and when Spell &amp; Trap Cards are used, they're sent face-up to this space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The contents of both players' Graveyards are public knowledge: you and your opponent can look through both at any time during the Duel.</li>
  <li>The order of the cards in the Graveyard should not be changed.</li>
  <li>Graveyard is shortened in the card text to "GY".</li>
  <li>If multiple cards are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, it is the owner of those cards that decides the order in which they are placed in the Graveyard, regardless of the controller of the effect.</li>
  <li>If cards are sent to the Graveyard, they are always sent to the owner's Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Deck Zone</h3>
<p>Your Deck is placed face-down in this space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You draw cards from here to add to your hand.</li>
  <li>If a card effect requires you to reveal cards from your Deck, or look through it, shuffle it and put it back in this space afterwards.</li>
  <li>The cards in your Main Deck are always private. Aside from effects that let you search cards in the Deck like "add a card from the Deck to the hand" or "Special Summon a monster from the Deck", the order and information of cards in the Deck cannot be verified by either player.</li>
  <li>The number of cards in the Main Deck is public knowledge. Both players can always verify the number of cards in the Deck.</li>
  <li>If an effect that searches cards in the Deck is resolved, the Main Deck must always be shuffled after resolving that effect.</li>
  <li>If an effect only says "Deck", without specifying yours or the opponent's, that effect can only affect your Deck.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extra Deck Zone</h3>
<p>Place your Extra Deck face-down in this space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can look at the cards in your own Extra Deck during the game.</li>
  <li>During a Duel, Extra Deck Monsters may be Summoned to the field from here using special methods.</li>
  <li>The face-down cards in the Extra Deck are private to the opponent.</li>
  <li>The number of cards in the Extra Deck is public knowledge. Both players can always verify the number of cards in both Extra Decks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding Pendulum Monster Cards:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pendulum Monster Cards that would be sent from the field to the Graveyard are placed face-up here.</li>
  <li>The Pendulum Monsters that were added to the Extra Deck face-up are public knowledge. Both players can always verify the face-up cards in both Extra Decks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hand</h3>

<p>Players hold the cards they draw from the Deck or otherwise during the Duel as a hand.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cards in the hand are private information to the opponent. Also, cards in the hand do not have an order.</li>
  <li>The number of cards in the hand is public knowledge. Both players can always verify the number of cards in the hand.</li>
  <li>If the turn player has 7 or more cards in their hand, that player must discard cards from their hand to the Graveyard until they have 6 cards when the End Phase ends. Cards discarded by this resolution are not treated as being discarded by a card effect.</li>
  <li>In most cases if an effect that says "send cards from the hand to the Graveyard" or "Special Summon from the hand" does not specify yours or the opponent's, the effect can only affect cards in your hand.</li>
  <li>If a monster effect in the hand is activated, the activation is declared by showing that card to the opponent.</li>
  <li>If a card is revealed to the hand to the opponent by a particular effect, the card in the hand becomes public knowledge. If the effect that revealed the card is no longer applied, that card becomes private.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Banished/Banishment</h3>

Cards that are banished from play by card effects are placed outside of the Dueling Field.
<ul>
  <li>Banished cards are not placed in any appointed Zone of the Dueling Field, but the cards of each player must be placed in one place in which they can be distinguished.</li>
  <li>In most cases, if it is not specified that cards are banished face-up or face-down, they are banished face-up. The information of cards banished face-up and the number of banished cards is public knowledge. Both players can always verify the information of face-up banished cards, as well as the total number of cards that are banished face-up and face-down.</li>
  <li>In most cases, banished cards are treated as cards from their owner. However, if a card is banished temporarily and later returned to the field with cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36553319"> "Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span>, they are treated as cards from their owner while they are banished, but when they are returned to the field, they are returned to their controller before they were banished. Also, when a card that is banished temporarily from the Extra Monster Zone returns, it is returned to a Main Monster Zone of the previous controller. At that time, if there are no available Main Monster Zones, it does not return to the field and it is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Face-down banished</h4>

<p>Cards banished by an effect that says "banish face-down" are banished face-down. Face-down banished cards are private information, in most cases only the owner can verify them.</p>
