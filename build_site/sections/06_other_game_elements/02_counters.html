        A counter is a marker that may need to place on cards for some card effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<ul>
  <li>
    Counters themselves do not perform any effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot place counters unless a card effect allows it<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards may have effects that change with the number of counters on them, or require you to remove counters as a cost<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some counters have specific names, such as "Spell Counter" or "Clock Counter." Other than their names, each individual counter itself does not have any effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Counters cannot be placed on face-down cards. If a card that has counters placed on itself is flipped face-down, those counters are removed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If counters that can only be placed on a particular card like itself are placed on a card that has its effects negated, those counters are removed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40089744">"Gateway to Chaos"</span> that had Spell Counters placed on itself by its effect that says "Each time a Monster Card(s) is sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard, place 1 Spell Counter on this card for each of those cards" has its effects negated by an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37267041">"Silent Swordsman LV7"</span>, the Spell Counters are removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If counters are placed on another card by an effect that places counters, even if the effects of that card are negated, the counters are not removed.
    <br />
    Example: Ice Counters placed by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73659078">"Snowdust Giant"</span> that says "reveal any number of WATER monsters from your hand, and place that many Ice Counters on face-up monsters on the field" are not removed if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73659078">"Snowdust Giant"</span> has its effects negated.
  </li>
