<ul>
  <li>
    Counters themselves do not perform any effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot place counters unless a card effect allows it<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards may have effects that change with the number of counters on them, or require you to remove counters as a cost<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some counters have specific names, such as "Spell Counter" or "Clock Counter." Other than their names, each individual counter itself does not have any effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Counters cannot be placed on face-down cards. If a card that has counters placed on itself is flipped face-down, those counters are removed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If counters that can only be placed on a particular card like itself are placed on a card that has its effects negated, those counters are removed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40089744">"Gateway to Chaos"</span> that had Spell Counters placed on itself by its effect that says "Each time a Monster Card(s) is sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard, place 1 Spell Counter on this card for each of those cards" has its effects negated by an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37267041">"Silent Swordsman LV7"</span>, the Spell Counters are removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If counters are placed on another card by an effect that places counters, even if the effects of that card are negated, the counters are not removed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: Ice Counters placed by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73659078">"Snowdust Giant"</span> that says "reveal any number of WATER monsters from your hand, and place that many Ice Counters on face-up monsters on the field" are not removed if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73659078">"Snowdust Giant"</span> has its effects negated.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Unaffected</h3>
<p>Placing a counter affects the monster:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A monster (1) that has a counter placed on it and an effect is applying to all monsters with that counter (2). Even if (1) becomes unaffected by cards' effects, the counter is not removed and (2) keeps applying and affecting (1).</li>
  <li>A monster (1) is unaffected or becomes unaffected by cards' effects. Subsequent effects that try to put counters on (1) will not put any counter on (1).</li>
</ul>

<p>Example: a monster has had a "Cubic Counter" placed on it by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15610297">"Vijam the Cubic Seed"</span>. Once a monster has had a "Cubic Counter" placed on it, even if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49032236">"Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"</span> is then applied to the monster, the "Cubic Counter" is not removed. That monster remains unable to attack, and its effects remain negated. Conversely, if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49032236">"Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"</span> has already been applied to a monster, and that monster then battles a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15610297">"Vijam the Cubic Seed"</span> whose effect then resolves, no "Cubic Counter" will be placed on the monster. (As a result, its effects will not be negated, and it will still be able to attack).</p>
