        Monster Tokens are monsters that appear on the field as the result of a card's effect, for example <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73915051">"Scapegoat"</span><sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.

<ul>
  <li>
    They are not included in the Deck, and cannot be sent anywhere other than the field, such as the hand or Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are simply removed from the field instead<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. If Monster Tokens leave the field, they do not go to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each Monster Token takes up 1 of your 5 Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Their battle position is always either face-up Attack Position or faceup Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Monster Tokens cannot be in face-down Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens cannot be sent to the Graveyard to activate effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens can be used as Synchro Materials. In that case, they are not sent to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tokens cannot be used as an Xyz Material<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens can be used as Link Materials. In that case, they are not sent to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tokens on the field are treated as Normal Monsters<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. If the activation or resolution of some effect is related to the Monster Token, those effects belong to the effect of the card that Special Summoned the Monster Token<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: The effect of an "Deus Token" summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>, which says ""Deus Token" cannot be destroyed by battle", is not applied as the effect of the "Deus Token", but rather as part of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The original ATK of Monster Tokens is the value determined by the effect that summoned them. If an ATK/DEF value of "?" is printed on the effect that summoned the token, the original ATK/DEF of the token is "?"<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Banishing a token is a conjunction success</h3>
<p>If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).</p>

<h3>Equipping Monsters</h3>
<p>
  Tokens placed in the Spell & Trap Zone have the ATK printed on the card that Special Summoned the Token.
  <br />
  Example: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span> can be equipped with a Token by its own effect. For example, if a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17418745">"Photon Token"</span> that was Special Summoned by the effect of Photon Sanctuary is equipped to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span>, the second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span> will increase its own ATK by the original ATK of the equipped <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17418745">"Photon Token"</span>, which is 2000.

<h3>Summon from Spell/Trap/Pendulum Zone</h3>
<p>
  Tokens cannot be Special Summoned from the Spell & Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. <br />
  Example:
  <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span> can be equipped with a Token by its own effect. The equipped Photon Token cannot be targeted when activating the last effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span> that Special Summons one of the monsters equipped to it<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Similarly, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53639887">"Divine Temple of the Snake-Eye"</span> can't summon a token from the Spell/Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
