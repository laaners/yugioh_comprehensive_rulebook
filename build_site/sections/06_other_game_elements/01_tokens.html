    When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are simply removed from the field instead<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    Each Monster Token takes up 1 of your 5 Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    Their battle position is always either face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    Monster Tokens can be used as Synchro, Fusion ad Link Materials. In that case, they are not sent to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

    Tokens on the field are treated as Normal Monsters<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      The effect of an "Deus Token" summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>, which says ""Deus Token" cannot be destroyed by battle", is not applied as the effect of the "Deus Token", but rather as part of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>.

    The original ATK of Monster Tokens is the value determined by the effect that summoned them. If an ATK/DEF value of "?" is printed on the effect that summoned the token, the original ATK/DEF of the token is "?"<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      When your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89631139">"Blue-Eyes White Dragon"</span> attacks you directly and you take 3000 damage, you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671151">"The Golden Apples"</span> and Special Summon a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671152">"Malus Token"</span>. the ATK and DEF of the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671152">"Malus Token"</span> will each be 3000. If your opponent then activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73048641">"Half Shut"</span> and targets the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671152">"Malus Token"</span>, its current ATK of 3000 becomes half that value, so it will have 1500 ATK (The DEF remains 3000). Then, when the turn ends and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73048641">"Half Shut"</span> stops applying, the ATK of the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671152">"Malus Token"</span> returns to its original value (Since the original ATK of the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671152">"Malus Token"</span> is "?", the ATK becomes 0. The ATK never returns to 3000, but the DEF remains 3000)<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup

<h3>Banishing a token is a conjunction success</h3>
<p>
  If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74701381">"DNA Surgery"</span> is applying, and Dragon-Type is declared, you can target a Monster Token treated as Dragon-Type to banish with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20638610">"Dragon's Rebirth"</span>. Even in this case, the effect of Special Summoning a Dragon-Type monster from your hand or Graveyard is applied normally.
