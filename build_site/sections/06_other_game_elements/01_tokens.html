        Monster Tokens are monsters that appear on the field as the result of a card's effect, for example <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73915051">"Scapegoat"</span><sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are simply removed from the field instead<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    Their battle position is always either face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    Monster Tokens can be used as Synchro, Fusion ad Link Materials. In that case, they are not sent to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

    If the activation or resolution of some effect is related to the Monster Token, those effects belong to the effect of the card that Special Summoned the Monster Token<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      The effect of an "Deus Token" summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>, which says ""Deus Token" cannot be destroyed by battle", is not applied as the effect of the "Deus Token", but rather as part of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>.

      <u>Question:</u><br />If "Asmo Token" and "Deus Token" are Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>' effect, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> is activated afterwards, can the "Asmo Token" be destroyed by card effects, and can the "Deus Token" be destroyed by battle?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Tokens are treated as Normal Monsters, and have no effects.<br />Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> begins applying after the Tokens are Special Summoned, the "Asmo Token" still cannot be destroyed by card effects, and the "Deus Token" still cannot be destroyed by battle. (Note that these tokens are indestructible due to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>' effect.)<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup>

    The original ATK of Monster Tokens is the value determined by the effect that summoned them. If an ATK/DEF value of "?" is printed on the effect that summoned the token, the original ATK/DEF of the token is "?"<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />When my opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89631139">"Blue-Eyes White Dragon"</span> attacks me directly and I take 3000 damage, I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671151">"The Golden Apples"</span> and Special Summon a Malus Token.<br />If my opponent then activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73048641">"Half Shut"</span> and targets the Malus Token, what happens to its ATK and DEF?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the given situation, when you take 3000 battle damage and activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42671151">"The Golden Apples"</span>, the ATK and DEF of the Malus Token will each be 3000.<br />When the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73048641">"Half Shut"</span> is applied to the Malus Token, its current ATK of 3000 becomes half that value, so it will have 1500 ATK. (The DEF remains 3000.)<br />Then, when the turn ends and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73048641">"Half Shut"</span> stops applying, the ATK of the Malus Token returns to its original value. (Since the original ATK of the Malus Token is "?", the ATK becomes 0. The ATK never returns to 3000, but the DEF remains 3000.)

<h3>Banishing and tributing a Token is a conjunction success</h3>
<p>
  If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <u>Question:</u><br />While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74701381">"DNA Surgery"</span> is applying, and Dragon-Type is declared, can a Monster Token treated as Dragon-Type be banished by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20638610">"Dragon's Rebirth"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can target a Monster Token treated as Dragon-Type to banish with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20638610">"Dragon's Rebirth"</span>. Even in this case, the effect of Special Summoning a Dragon-Type monster from your hand or Graveyard is applied normally<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>Question:</u><br />I activate&nbsp;<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51684157">"Heavenly Dragon Circle"</span> tributing a&nbsp;Tenyi Spirit Token. When resolving the effect, can I Special Summon a Wyrm Normal Monster from my Deck instead of adding it to my hand?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />As in the given situation, if you Tributed a non-Effect Monster to activate&nbsp;<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51684157">"Heavenly Dragon Circle"</span>, you can Special Summon a Wyrm Normal Monster from your Deck instead of adding it to your hand<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>Question:</u><br />Can I target a Token for the "target 1 face-up monster you control and this card; banish both those targets, then draw 2 cards" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3657444">"Cyber Valley"</span>? If I do, will I still draw 2 cards?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can target a Token with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3657444">"Cyber Valley"</span> that draws 2 cards. When this effect then resolves, only <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3657444">"Cyber Valley"</span> ends up banished, but you still draw 2 cards. (Note that the Monster Token disappeared upon leaving the field.)<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>Question:</u><br />Can a Fiend-Type Token be banished with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63883999">"Archfiend Palabyrinth"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, a Fiend-Type Token can be banished with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63883999">"Archfiend Palabyrinth"</span>. Even in that case, the effect of Special Summoning an "Archfiend" monster still applies normally<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
