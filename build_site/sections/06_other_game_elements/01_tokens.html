        Monster Tokens are monsters that appear on the field as the result of a card's effect, for example <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73915051">"Scapegoat"</span><sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<ul>
  <li>
    They are not included in the Deck, and cannot be sent anywhere other than the field, such as the hand or Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are simply removed from the field instead<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. If Monster Tokens leave the field, they do not go to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each Monster Token takes up 1 of your 5 Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Their battle position is always either face-up Attack Position or faceup Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Monster Tokens cannot be in face-down Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens cannot be sent to the Graveyard to activate effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens can be used as Synchro Materials. In that case, they are not sent to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tokens cannot be used as an Xyz Material<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monster Tokens can be used as Link Materials. In that case, they are not sent to the Graveyard and are removed from the Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tokens on the field are treated as Normal Monsters<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. If the activation or resolution of some effect is related to the Monster Token, those effects belong to the effect of the card that Special Summoned the Monster Token<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: The effect of an "Deus Token" summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>, which says ""Deus Token" cannot be destroyed by battle", is not applied as the effect of the "Deus Token", but rather as part of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85771019">"Darklord Asmodeus"</span>.

<h3>Banishing a token is a conjunction success</h3>
<p>If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).</p>
