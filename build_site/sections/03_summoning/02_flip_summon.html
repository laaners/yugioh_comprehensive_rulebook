<h2>Flip Summon</h2>
<p>
  You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot use most monsters' effects until they are face-up<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the Chain started by an effect that's trying to negate an attempted Flip Summon, the monster that's being Flip Summoned is treated as a face-up monster in the Monster Zone. However, if that monster is an effect monster, its effects are not activated/applied yet<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.

      <u>Question:</u><br />The only monster on my side of the field is a face-down Defense Position <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95788410">"Rabidragon"</span>. If I Flip Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95788410">"Rabidragon"</span>, and my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span>, can I chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82382815">"Champion's Vigilance"</span> ?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, you can.<br />During the Chain started by an effect that's trying to negate an attempted Flip Summon, the monster that's being Flip Summoned is treated as a face-up monster in the Monster Zone. (However, if that monster is an effect monster, its effects are not activated/applied yet.)<br />Therefore, when responding to your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span>, you control a Level 7 or higher Normal Monster, and the activation conditions for <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82382815">"Champion's Vigilance"</span> are therefore met.
