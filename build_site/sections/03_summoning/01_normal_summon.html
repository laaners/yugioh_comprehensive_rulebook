<h2>Normal Summon</h2>
<p>
  This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a Monster Card from your hand onto the field in face-up Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters (unless they have a specific restriction), can be Summoned in this way<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>
  If a Normal Summon is performed, a card that "negates the Normal Summon" can be used in response to that Normal Summon. Even if the Normal Summon is negated, in most cases you cannot perform another Normal Summon/Set<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A monster that has its Normal Summon/Set negated is sent to the Graveyard providing no particular effect is being applied. In that case, that monster is not treated as being sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a monster that does not have its Normal Summon/Set negated is placed on the field, this is called a "successful Normal Summon(/Set)"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Normal Set</h3>
<p>
  To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A monster Normal Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned. It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or flipped face-up by an attack or card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot play a monster from your hand onto the field in face-up Defense Position.<br />
    As an exception, if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62867251">"Light of Intervention"</span> that says "If a Monster Card would be Set, it must be Normal Summoned in face-up Defense Position" is being applied, a Normal Summon/Set can be performed in face-up Defense Position. This Normal Summon/Set is not treated as a Set<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are some cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43434803">"The Shallow Grave"</span> that "Set in face-down Defense Position" while resolving their card effect. In that case, the monsters are treated as being Special Summoned in face-down Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are some cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17032740">"Elemental HERO Chaos Neos"</span> with effects that "Set" face-up monsters while resolving their card effect. In that case, those face-up monsters are changed to face-down Defense Position, and this is treated as a Set<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tribute Summon</h3>
<p>
  For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<table align="center" style="width: 60%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b> Level 5,6 </b>
      </td>
      <td>
        <b> Level 7 or higher </b>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 Tribute</td>
      <td>2 Tributes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Tribute Summon that Tributes 1 or more monsters can be performed by Tributing monsters even if there are no Main Monster Zones available<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are monsters like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="78651105">"Beast King Barbaros"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000020">"Slifer the Sky Dragon"</span> that can be Tribute Summoned by Tributing the amount of monsters written in their texts. If a monster like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="78651105">"Beast King Barbaros"</span> that says "You can Normal Summon/Set this card without Tributing" is Normal Summoned/Set without a Tribute, this is not treated as a Tribute Summon<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If monsters are Tributed for a Tribute Summon, the Normal Summon of the monster is performed afterwards. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can [...]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Tributes for a Tribute Summon</h4>

<p>Sending monsters on the field to the Graveyard for a Tribute Summon is called Tributing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Face-down monsters on the field can also be Tributed.</li>
  <li>The Tributes are performed at the time the Tribute Summon is declared, before the monster that would be Normal Summoned/Set is placed on the field. Even if the Tribute Summon is negated, the Tributed monsters are sent to the Graveyard normally.</li>
  <li>You can only Tribute monsters you control.</li>
  <li>Monster Tokens on the field can also be Tributed. In this case, the tokens are not sent to the Graveyard and they are removed from the Duel.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be Tributed. In that case, that Tributed Trap Card is sent to the Graveyard, providing no particular effect is being applied.</li>
  <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29549364">"Mask of Restrict"</span> has been activated, so that monsters cannot be Tributed, a Tribute Summon cannot be performed.</li>
  <li>Monsters that you control in the Extra Monster Zones can also be used as tributes for a Tribute Summon.</li>
  <li>Even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, monsters can still be Tributed. In that case, the Tributed monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead.</li>
</ul>
