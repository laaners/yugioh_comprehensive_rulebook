<h2>Special Summon</h2>
<p>
  Some monsters can be played onto the field without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Link Summons, Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some Effect Monsters also have specific conditions that allow you to Special Summon them<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless otherwise specified, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the field in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Aside from Pendulum Summoning, Special Summons can be performed any number of times per turn<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Special Summon cannot be performed if there are no available Monster Zones. However, if monsters leave the field in order to meet the requirements for the Special Summon, the procedure or resolution for the Special Summon can be conducted even if there are no available Monster Zones in most cases<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The player can choose any available Main Monster Zone in which to place the monster that would be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Special Summon is not negated, placing the monster on the field constitutes a "successful Special Summon"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Summon through requirements</h3>

<p>
  During their Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect, the turn player can Special Summon a monster by meeting the requirements written in that monster's Effect Text<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >. These are monsters that can Special Summon themselves in a special way that doesn't start a Chain, their Special Summon by meeting requirements is also called Built-In Summons. This includes cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70095154">"Cyber Dragon"</span>, Link Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, and Contact Fusions are also part of this group<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a Special Summon is performed by meeting requirements, a card that "negates Special Summons" can be activated in response to that Special Summon<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A monster that has its Special Summon negated is sent to the Graveyard providing no particular effect is being applied. In that case, the monster that was sent to the Graveyard is not considered to be sent from the hand, field, or Extra Deck to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Performing a Special Summon by meeting requirements does not start a chain<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards that are Tributed or sent to the Graveyard in order to meet requirements are moved to a different place for the procedure of the Special Summon and are not treated as being moved by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If monsters are Tributed or sent to the Graveyard to meet requirements, the Special Summon of the monster is performed afterwards. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can do [effect]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="46044841">"Gusto Falco"</span> is used as a Material for a Synchro Summon, that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="46044841">"Gusto Falco"</span> is sent to the Graveyard as a Material, but since the Special Summon of the Synchro Monster is performed afterwards, its effect that says "When this face-up card on the field is sent to the Graveyard, except by battle: You can Special Summon 1 "Gusto" monster from your Deck in face-down Defense Position." cannot be activated.</li>
      <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14778250">"The Tricky"</span> is Special Summoned by sending <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> from the hand to the Graveyard, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span>'s effect that says "You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated as the last action that happened is the summon of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14778250">"The Tricky"</span> and not <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> being sent to the Graveyard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Special Summon Monsters and Properly Special Summon</h4>

<p>
  Special Summon Monsters are monsters that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set and are Special Summoned according to the summoning procedure written on the card (Built-In Summons). Fusion, Ritual, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters are all Special Summon Monsters. In addition to these, there are also monsters that must be Special Summoned by the procedure written in their text<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Special Summoning Special Summon monsters by their requirements is not treated as the resolution of an effect. However, in order to properly Special Summon Fusion Monsters and Ritual Monsters, they are treated as being Special Summoned by the resolution of an activated card<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Special Summon monsters that say "cannot be Special Summoned by other ways" in their Summoning requirements can only be Special Summoned by that method, and cannot be Special Summoned by the effects of other cards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Special Summon monsters cannot be Special Summoned by other card effects unless they are previously Special Summoned by the method described in their texts. However, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz and Link Monsters can be Special Summoned by effects that say "Special Summon from the Extra Deck" in most cases<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a monster Special Summoned by the proper procedure that is later added to the Deck, hand, or other private location, that monster is no longer treated as being Special Summoned by the proper procedure<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards with effects that say "ignoring its Summoning conditions" can Special Summon Special Summon monsters from the Deck, Extra Deck or hand (private knowledge) without Special Summoning them by the proper procedure<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14799437">"Infernoid Onuncu"</span> can be Special Summoned from the Deck by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23587624">"A Wild Monster Appears!"</span>.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if the Flip Summon of a properly summoned Special Summon Monster is negated, that monster will still be treated as having been properly summoned<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Summon with a Card's Effect</h3>
<p>
  Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the field through the effect of another card. This is different from "Special Summon Monsters"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >, Spell/Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> unless it was properly Special Summoned first.
    <br />
    For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned first, before they can be Special Summoned by another card's effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a Special Summon is performed as a result of the resolution of an activated effect that started a chain, if the activation of the activated effect that started a chain is not negated, the resolution that performs the Special Summon cannot be negated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      After the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10194329">"Raidraptor - Avenge Vulture"</span> that says "If you take damage: You can Special Summon this card from your hand" was activated, cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> cannot be activated to negate the Special Summon when the effect is resolving. Afterwards, cards that respond to when a Special Summon is successful can be activated when the Special Summon is successful.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    Monsters that have effects to Special Summon themselves that activate are mostly written as ":/; Special Summon this card from your [location]". Also, those effects are Ignition Effects or Trigger Effects in most cases<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects of Spells, Traps and Monsters that Special Summon other cards are effects that activate and start a chain in most cases<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you Special Summon monsters to the opponent's field such as by activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29843091">"Ojama Trio"</span>, the Main Monster Zones in which they would be Special Summoned is chosen by the player who activated the effect in most cases<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    However, even if you activate an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45894482">"Gilasaurus"</span> in which the opponent performs the Special Summon, the opponent is the one who chooses the Main Monster Zone in which the monster would be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
