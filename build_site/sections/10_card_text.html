<h1>Card text</h1>
<h2>Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)</h2>
<p>
  Problem-Solving Card Text (often abbreviated PSCT) is a method of writing card text used for prints released from July 8, 2011 onward. The purpose of Problem-Solving Card Text is to specify card effects to the point that most situations can be resolved by logically interpreting the card text<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Problem-Solving Card Text uses specific words with very particular meanings in the context of gameplay. How to interpret the text is important to understanding how to apply card text to the game.</p>
<p>This interpretation can only be applied for cards that use Problem-Solving Card Text. Cards that were printed with earlier text may use some of the same terms or structures, but this does not necessarily mean that they work as if they were Problem-Solving Card Text.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    All card effects that make a Chain Link include a colon ":" or a semicolon ";" somewhere in their text (possibly both). If a card effect does not use either, it does not make a Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The activation of a Spell or Trap Card always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that resolves with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>. This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card's text.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>colon</strong> ":" describes <strong>activation conditions</strong> (limits on when or how often a card or effect can be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup>). These conditions only need to be met when the card is activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conditions other than target requirements that have to be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a separate sentence after the effect sentence (e.g. "Zombie Master", "Treeborn Frog")<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>semicolon</strong> ";" (but after the colon, if any) describes anything that happens when that card or effect is activated (such as <strong>costs and targeting</strong><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Built-In Special Summons (other than Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link) are denoted by parentheses "()" stating the location from which the monster can be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards with bulleted effects (●) that resolve in the same Chain Link specify whether they resolve simultaneously or sequentially (if sequentially, effects are applied in the order they are listed). In these cases, each effect activated resolves independent of the success of the other(s).
    <ul>
      <li>The text "in sequence" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied sequentially (e.g. "Gravekeeper's Oracle", "Advance Zone").</li>
      <li>The text "(simultaneously)" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied simultaneously (e.g. "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter", "Kunai with Chain").</li>
      <li>If neither is specified, the effects each make separate Chain Links (e.g. "Metaphys Horus").</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Activation condition/requirement</h3>
<p>An activation condition, also known as its activation requirement, is the set of conditions that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unless otherwise specified, the activation conditions only need to be satisfied when the card is activated, not when it resolves.</li>
  <li>On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the activation condition is written before a colon ":", at the start of a card effect.</li>
</ul>
<em>References:</em>
<ol>
  <li>
    <br>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Activation_condition">Yugipedia</a>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>A cost is an action that must be performed in order to activate a card or effect, to perform another action, or to keep a card on the field. This is distinct from activation requirements, which are requirements that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Costs usually involve the player making a sacrifice of some type, such as paying Life Points (e.g. "Seven Tools of the Bandit" requires the player to pay 1000 Life Points), discarding, Tributing, banishing, detaching a card(s) or sending a card(s) to the Graveyard</li>
  <li>If a cost cannot be fully paid, none of the cost can be paid and the effect cannot be activated.</li>
  <li>A cost is not an effect. If a card is moved to a different location due to a cost, cards and effects that can only be activated when the card is moved by a card effect cannot be activated. For example, the effect of "Shaddoll Dragon" cannot be activated if it is sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate "Phoenix Wing Wind Blast".</li>
  <li>Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by "Skill Drain"), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost).</li>
  <li>On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the cost is written before a semicolon ";", at the start of a card effect or after the activation condition.</li>
</ul>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cost">Yugipedia</a>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Maintenance cost</h4>
<p>A maintenance cost is a cost required to keep a card on the field. They are typically paid during a player's Standby Phase or End Phase. If a player does not, or cannot, pay the maintenance cost of a card, then it will destroy itself (with the exception of "Gaia Plate the Earth Giant" and "Aerial Recharge", which simply send themselves to the Graveyard).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintenance costs are not effects, so they cannot be negated and do not activate or start a Chain Link; even if a card like "Skill Drain" or "Jinzo" is on the field and negating the card's effects, its maintenance cost still needs to be paid.</li>
  <li>Cards such as "Card Guard" and "Field Barrier" cannot protect these cards from destroying themselves due to not paying their maintenance cost, since it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>mandatory</strong> maintenance costs (such as "Imperial Order", "Degenerate Circuit", "Destructive Draw", "Mind Protector", "Red Screen", "Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"), the player does not have the option of choosing not to pay the cost and letting the card be destroyed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a mandatory maintenance cost requires LP and the player has exactly the specified amount left, since they must pay, they lose the Duel when the cost comes up due to reaching 0 LP (e.g. when the controller of "Imperial Order" happens to have 700 LP during the Standby Phase).</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Targeting is the action of designating which specific cards are affected or used by card effects at the activation of a card effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cards can be targeted if they are on the field, in the Graveyard, or banished. Cards in the hand, Main Deck, Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>, or attached as Xyz Material cannot be targeted.
  </li>
  <li>In Problem-Solving Card Text, cards and effects that target always explicitly state that they target: a card targets if and only if it uses the word "target".</li>
  <li>If a card or effect targets, its targets must be chosen when it is activated.</li>
  <li>You cannot choose to use a card or effect that targets unless there is a card for it to target.</li>
  <li>
    Equip Spell Cards always target, but activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If a card was targeted by a card or effect, but when the effect resolves that target has changed location, the target is no longer valid and cannot be affected as the target<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>. The player does not get to change their target or select another target at resolution.

<h4>Cannot "create" target through cost</h4>
<p>In order to activate a card (1) with a cost to pay and targets another card (2) for its effect (for example target (2) and Summon it from the Graveyard), a correct target (2) must be present (on the field, in the Graveyard, ...) before attempting (1)'s activation. Even if a valid target would be created after paying (1)'s cost, (1) cannot be activated.</p>

<h4>that target vs it</h4>
<p>The terms "that target" or "those targets" and "it" or "they/them" have specific meanings in the resolution of the effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    "That target" and "those targets" indicate that targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution to be affected. "Both (those) targets" and "all three targets" indicate that
    <strong>all</strong> targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution for any of them to be affected.
  </li>
  <li>"It" and "they/them" indicate that the targets do not need to meet the target requirements at resolution, only when targeted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conjunctives</h3>
<p>
  The conjunctives "and", "and if you do", "also", and "then" have specific meanings<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In "Do A, <strong>then</strong> do B", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do A <strong>and</strong> B", both A and B happen simultaneously. BOTH A and B are required. If you cannot do both, you do nothing<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do A, <strong>and if you do</strong>, do B", both A and B happen simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do A, <strong>also</strong> do B", both A and B happen simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.
  </li>
  <li>In "Do A, <strong>also, after that</strong>, do B", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur (This conjunctive was never discussed in the Problem-Solving Card Text articles, as it was not introduced until 2014).</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no conjunctive that indicates both parts of the effect are required while also indicating that the parts are not simultaneous. While this relationship is rare, it does occur for some effects—in particular, Fusion Summoning and Ritual Summoning effects, which normally text structures unique to that Summoning method, which do not use conjunctives at all for that part of their text. The card "Luminous Dragon Ritual" uniquely indicates this relationship with the conjunctive "and" followed by "after that" at the end of the second part of the effect.</p>
<div align="center">| | Neither required | A required | Both required | |-| ---------- | ----------------- |-| | <strong>Sequentially</strong> | also, after that | then | | | <strong>Simultaneously</strong> | also | and if you do | and |</div>

<h4>Banishing a token is a conjunction success</h4>
<p>If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).</p>

<h4>0 ATK/DEF, reduction, and conjunction success</h4>
<p>A card's (1) effect which lowers a stat of a monster with action A and then does an action B, if action A applies to a monster (2) whose stat is lower than 1000 (even 0), then B <strong>will</strong> apply (even if (2)'s ATK is already 0, B will apply even if A is required such as "if you do" conjunctive).</p>

<h2>Glossary: Terms and Phrases</h2>
<h3>Activate vs Use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cards that state "You can only activate this card once per turn/Duel" can be activated again in the same turn/Duel if their activation is negated.
    <ul>
      <li>For example: "Silver's Cry" (which can only be activated once per turn) and "The Seal of Orichalcos" (which can only be activated once per Duel) can be activated again during the same turn or Duel if another copy had its activation negated (such as by "Magic Jammer"), but not if only its effect was negated (such as by "Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy").</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that state "You can only use this effect once per turn/Duel" cannot be activated again in the same turn/Duel, even if their activation is negated.
    <ul>
      <li>For example: "Souleating Oviraptor" can only use each of its effects once per turn, while "Dotscaper" can only use each of its effects once per Duel, even if these monsters' effects are negated by a card such as "Solemn Strike".</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Attach</h3>
<h4>Attaching material affects the monster</h4>
<p>If an effect (1) that involves attaching a card (2) as an Xyz Material to a Xyz Monster on the field (3) is activated, if (3) is unaffected by cards' effects, then (1) resolves without attaching (2) to (3).</p>

<h3>Banish instead of sending to the Graveyard</h3>
<h4>Banish only monsters and paying cost</h4>
<p>When the effect "any Monster sent to the GY is banished instead" is applying you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cannot</strong> activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster to the Graveyard as a cost.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cannot</strong> activate a card or effect that send cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard as cost as there may be monster cards among them<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can</strong> activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster Card not treated as a Monster (for example treated as an Equip Spell Card) to the Graveyard as a cost<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>.

<h3>Battle/Battled</h3>
<p>A monster "battles" (and is "battling") starting from when it attacks or is attacked. This includes both monsters attacking other monsters, and monsters attacking a player's Life Points directly.</p>
<p>
  When a card requires a monster to have "battled" (past tense), the attack had to have reached the damage calculation portion of the Damage Step in order for the monster to have "battled". If the attack stops before damage calculation, the monster did not "battle". (Note that
  <strong>an attack was still declared</strong>, however, so in most cases the attacking monster cannot declare another attack).

<h3>Can only control 1</h3>
<p>Taking as examples "Rivalry of Warlords" and "Gozen Match", these are Continuous Trap Cards that make it so you can only control face-up monsters of 1 Type (for Rivalry) or 1 Attribute (for Gozen).</p>
<p>When this Trap Card's activation resolves, look at the face-up monsters you control. If they all have the same Type/Attribute, you don't have to do anything else. If there are different Types/Attributes, you choose 1 Type/Attribute to keep, and send your face-up monsters that aren't that Type/Attribute to the Graveyard.</p>

<h4>Destruction not by card effect</h4>
<p>Monsters which violate this kind of effects are sent to the graveyard and are not considered as destroyed by card effects.</p>

</ol>

<h4>What monsters can be summoned</h4>
<p>While Rivalry/Gozen is active and you have a face-up monster, you cannot Summon monsters that are a different Type/Attribute from the monster(s) you already control.</p>
<p>So you can't do any of the following to put a monster with the wrong Type/Attribute on your side of the field:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal Summon</li>
  <li>Tribute Summon</li>
  <li>Flip Summon</li>
  <li>Xyz Summon</li>
  <li>Synchro Summon</li>
  <li>Fusion Summon</li>
  <li>Special Summon with a monster's own effect.</li>
  <li>Activate a card or effect that would have to Special Summon a monster of the wrong Type/Attribute (including effects that could theoretically Summon anything, but currently cannot, such as "Monster Reborn" when you control Spellcasters but the only monsters in the Graveyard are Zombies).</li>
</ul>
<p>While Rivalry/Gozen is active, you can still Set monsters of any Type/Attribute, and you can Special Summon monsters of the wrong Type/Attribute face-down. But you can't Flip Summon them afterwards, and they're sent to the Graveyard after damage calculation if your opponent attacks them. (Also, in that case, you won't get the effects of cards that need to be destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, because they're sent to the Graveyard by the Trap Card's effect instead. But Flip Effects will still activate).</p>

<h4>Special Summoning cards and effects that can be activated</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You can activate cards and effects that would Summon the same Type/Attribute monster as you have on the field.</li>
  <li>
    You can also activate cards that would Summon more than one Type/Attribute of monster. The results depend on what you have on the field:
    <ul>
      <li>If you DON'T control any monsters: You can activate cards that would Summon monsters with more than one Type/Attribute. All of them are Summoned, but you must immediately pick one Type/Attribute and send all others to the Graveyard.</li>
      <li>If you already DO control a monster: First of all, if the Summoning effect targets, you can only target monsters with the right Type/Attribute. If the Summoning effect does NOT target, you can activate it as long as it is possible to resolve the effect using only monsters with the right Type/Attribute. In this case, only the right monsters are Summoned to the field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The same rule applies to the "Gladiator Beast" monsters and similar effects. You can return a Gladiator Beast to your Deck and activate its effect as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck that you COULD Summon that is the same Type/Attribute as the one you returned. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon any Type/Attribute of monster.</p>

<h4>Taking control</h4>
<p>You can take control of an opponent's monster that's the wrong Type/Attribute with a card like "Mind Control". If you do, it's sent to the Graveyard immediately after you gain control of it.</p>

<h3>Control/Possess</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cards you "control" are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell &amp; Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone.</li>
  <li>Cards in your "possession" include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the field, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller's side of the field. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner.</p>

<h3>Destroy</h3>
<p>A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered "destroyed." always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner.</p>

<h3>Discard</h3>
<p>Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase.</p>

<h3>Equip to</h3>
<p>In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards</li>
  <li>Equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term "Equip Card" includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters).</p>

<h4>Equipped Monster</h4>
<p>A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an "equipped monster." When this monster is destroyed or flipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</p>

  </li>

<h4>Move equipped Monster Card to another target</h4>
<p>If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTION</strong>: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects.</p>

<h3>Excavate</h3>
<p>When a card says to "excavate" cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions</p>

<h3>Leaves the field</h3>
<p>Some monsters have effects that activate when they "leave the field". For example, these effects activate when the monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck.</p>
<p>When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck.</p>

<h3>Name treated as ...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    If cards with an effect that say "This card's name is
    <strong>always</strong> treated as [...]" are included in the Deck, the card is treated as having that card name, for example: since "Cyber Harpie Lady" says "(This card's name is always treated as "Harpie Lady".)", you can only include up to 3 copies in total of "Harpie Lady" and "Cyber Harpie Lady" in your Main Deck.
  </li>
  <li>
    Up to 3 copies of cards that are treated as having a different name by an effect can be included separately from cards with the name that is provided by that effect, for example: you can include 3 copies of each "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and "Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon" which has an effect that says "This card's name
    <strong>becomes</strong> "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" while it is on the <strong>field or in the Graveyard</strong>."

<h3>Piercing Battle Damage</h3>
<p>Some monsters can inflict piercing battle damage when they attack a Defense Position monster. This means that you inflict damage to your opponent's LP equal to the difference between the attacking monster's ATK and the defending monster's DEF.</p>

<h3>Random</h3>
<p>When a card effect says to choose a card randomly, there is no official way of doing so, it is fine as long as neither player has a way of knowing which card is being chosen.</p>

<h3>Reveal</h3>
<p>When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card or its Flip effect. Normally, revealed cards are returned to their original position after being looked at by both players.</p>

<h3>Send to the Graveyard</h3>
<p>A card can be sent to the Graveyard in various ways. Destroying a card, discarding, and Tributing a monster are all actions that send a card to the Graveyard, and will normally activate "When/If this card is sent to the Graveyard..." Trigger Effects.</p>

<h3>Summon from Spell/Trap Zone (and vice versa)</h3>
<p>
  If an effect (1) targets a Monster Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone ((1) is not treated as a monster), if another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone, then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) resolves without effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.\ Similary, if (1) targets (2) while in a Monster Zone but (2) is placed in the Spell/Trap Zone, (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) resolves without effect<sup><a href="#summon_from_spell_trap_zone-2">[2]</a></sup>.

<h3>Tribute</h3>
<p>Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or activating an effect. A monster sent to the Graveyard by Tributing is not treated as "destroyed."</p>

<h3>Unaffected</h3>
<h4>Attaching material affects the monster</h4>
<p>If an effect (1) that involves attaching a card (2) as an Xyz Material to a Xyz Monster on the field (3) is activated, if (3) is unaffected by cards' effects, then (1) resolves without attaching (2) to (3), and (1) is sent to the Graveyard.</p>

<h2>Effects Interaction</h2>
<h3>Activation legality</h3>
<h4>Targeting, location and cost</h4>
<p>In order to activate a card (1) with a cost to pay and targets another card (2) for its effect (for example target (2) and Summon it from the Graveyard), a correct target (2) must be present (on the field, in the Graveyard, ...) before attempting (1)'s activation. Even if a valid target would be created after paying (1)'s cost, (1) cannot be activated.</p>

<h4>Add, discard and send</h4>
<p>A card's (1) effect which involves adding a card (2) with a certain property and then discarding/sending a card (3) with (2)'s same property, (1) can be activated even if there are no cards of with (2)'s property in your hand at the moment of (1)'s activation.</p>

<h3>Change of control shenanigans with lack of space</h3>
<p>If your monster Zones are full you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cannot</strong> activate optional effects that would take control of an opponent's monster</li>
  <li><strong>Can</strong> activate mandatory effects that would take control of an opponent's monster</li>
</ul>
<p>Also you <strong>can</strong> activate optional effects that would take control of more than one opponent's monsters when you have at least one free Monster Zone, even if the number of monsters you would take control at resolution exceed the number of your free Monster Zones</p>
<p>After a successful activation of such card, if you do not have enough room in your Monster Zones, the extras are destroyed.</p>

<h3>Location changes mid-chain</h3>
<p>If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location<em> changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate. [</em>On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck.]</p>

<h3>Retaining information</h3>
<h4>Monsters with multiple attributes count for all their attributes when used as material.</h4>
<p>A monster (1) who gains different effects based on the materials used for its Summon, if one (2) of the materials had an effect on the field that treated its attribute as multiple attributes, then (1) will gain all the respective effects based on the multiple attributes of (2).</p>
