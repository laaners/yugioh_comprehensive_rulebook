<ul>
  <li>
    If an effect that Summon states "Immediately after this effect resolves", it instructs a player to perform a Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link Summon at the <strong>resolution</strong> of the Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A monster summoned by such effects is <strong>not</strong> considered to have been "Special Summoned by an activated Monster/Spell/Trap effect"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If this kind of effect first summon some monsters from a location(s) to the field then performs the Special Summon with the monsters summoned:
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have to use all the monsters summoned to perform the Special Summon<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
        <details>
          <summary>Example</summary>
          If you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29087919">"Geargia Change"</span> by targeting exatctly 3 "Geargiano" monsters in your Graveyard, you must use all three of the Special Summoned monsters as material for the Xyz Summon. It is not possible to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29087919">"Geargia Change"</span> by targeting 3 monsters, and then only use 2 of the 3 Special Summoned monsters as material for the Xyz Summon.

      <li>
        The timing of summoning the monsters and then performing the Special Summon immediately afters are two separate timings that don't happen at the same time ("then" conjunctive)<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >.
        <details>
          <summary>Example</summary>
          You activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61314842">"Advanced Heraldry Art"</span> while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is face-up in your opponent's Spell & Trap Zone, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is applied each time you Special Summon. The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61314842">"Advanced Heraldry Art"</span> Special Summons the 2 targeted "Heraldic Beast" monsters from your Graveyard, then finishes resolving. After <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61314842">"Advanced Heraldry Art"</span> resolves, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is applied and sends 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard. Then, when you perform the Xyz Summon using the 2 Special Summoned monsters as materials, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is applied again and sends another 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard. In this case, the first set of 3 cards sent to the Graveyard and the second set of 3 cards sent to the Graveyard are not treated as being sent at the same time.
