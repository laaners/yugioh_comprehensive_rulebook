<ul>
  <li>
    If an effect that Summon states "Immediately after this effect resolves", it instructs a player to perform a Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link Summon at the <strong>resolution</strong> of the Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A monster summoned by such effects is <strong>not</strong> considered to have been "Special Summoned by an activated Monster/Spell/Trap effect"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If this kind of effect first summon some monsters from a location(s) to the field then performs the Special Summon with the monsters summoned:
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have to use all the monsters summoned to perform the Special Summon<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
        <details>
          <summary>Example</summary>
          If you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29087919">"Geargia Change"</span> by targeting exatctly 3 "Geargiano" monsters in your Graveyard, you must use all three of the Special Summoned monsters as material for the Xyz Summon. It is not possible to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29087919">"Geargia Change"</span> by targeting 3 monsters, and then only use 2 of the 3 Special Summoned monsters as material for the Xyz Summon.

      <li>
        The timing of summoning the monsters and then performing the Special Summon immediately afters are two separate timings that don't happen at the same time ("then" conjunctive)<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >.
        <details>
          <summary>Example</summary>
          You activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61314842">"Advanced Heraldry Art"</span> while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is face-up in your opponent's Spell & Trap Zone, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is applied each time you Special Summon. The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61314842">"Advanced Heraldry Art"</span> Special Summons the 2 targeted "Heraldic Beast" monsters from your Graveyard, then finishes resolving. After <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61314842">"Advanced Heraldry Art"</span> resolves, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is applied and sends 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard. Then, when you perform the Xyz Summon using the 2 Special Summoned monsters as materials, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87844926">"Soul Levy"</span> is applied again and sends another 3 cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard. In this case, the first set of 3 cards sent to the Graveyard and the second set of 3 cards sent to the Graveyard are not treated as being sent at the same time.

<h3>Properties Changing</h3>
<p>An effect (1) is applying that changes properties of monsters face-up on the field.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can activate an effect (2) that summons back monsters (3) from a location (like the Graveyard) to the field and immediately after at resolution performs a Special Summon of a monster (4), as long as (3) and their properties satisfied the summoning requirements for (4) when (3) were in their original location (like the Graveyard).</li>
  <li>But when (3) are summoned back to the field, as (1) is applying, if (1) changes (3)'s properties so that you can't summon (4) at resolution anymore, you must summon another monster that can be summoned with (3) after their properties have changed from the same location(s) of (4).</li>
  <li>If there are no monsters that can be summoned from the location(s) of (4), after summoning back (3), (2) resolves without performing the Special Summon.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81489939">"Stygian Dirge"</span> is face-up on the field. You can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29087919">"Geargia Change"</span> targeting "Geargiano" monsters that are Level 3 in your Graveyard, as long as you are able to Xyz Summon a Rank 3 monster using the targeted monsters. In this scenario, since the Levels of the targeted monsters are reduced by 1 after being Special Summoned, you cannot Xyz Summon a Rank 3 monster, and you must instead Xyz Summon a Rank 2 monster if one exists in your Extra Deck. At this time, if you do not have a Rank 2 monster in your Extra Deck, the Xyz Summon is not performed.
