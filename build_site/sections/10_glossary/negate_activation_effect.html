    If the activation of an effect is negated, the resolution of that effect is not performed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the activation of the effect of a card on the field is negated, that card remains on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, cards that have the activation of their effects negated are not moved from their location. If the effect says something like "negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it", after being negated, the card is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that negate the activations of the effects of Spells, Traps, or Effect Monsters and destroy them can negate the activation of cards that are placed face-up on the field to be activated, as well as when a face-up card on the field or one in the hand, Graveyard, etc. activates its effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The effect that negates activations must be activated in a chain directly to the activation of the effect that would be negated<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
