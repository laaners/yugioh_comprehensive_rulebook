<ul>
  <li>A monster "battles" (and is "battling") starting from when it attacks or is attacked. This includes both monsters attacking other monsters, and monsters attacking a player's Life Points directly.</li>
  <li>When a card requires a monster to have "battled" (past tense), the attack had to have reached the damage calculation portion of the Damage Step in order for the monster to have "battled". If the attack stops before damage calculation, the monster did not "battle". (Note that <strong>an attack was still declared</strong>, however, so in most cases the attacking monster cannot declare another attack).</li>

<h3>End of the Damage Step still occurs even if damage calculation was never conducted: "having attacked"</h3>
<p>
  A card whose effect reads "at the end of the Damage Step" can be activated even if damage calculation has not been conducted and Before Damage Calculation has been reached<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    Your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56532353">"Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"</span> attacks your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26593852">"Ally of Justice Catastor"</span>. At the Start of the Damage Step, the "destroy that monster" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26593852">"Ally of Justice Catastor"</span> is activated, however you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49010598">"Divine Wrath"</span> in response, negating the activation and destroying <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26593852">"Ally of Justice Catastor"</span>, and therefore damage calculation is not conducted. However, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56532353">"Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"</span> is still attacking, and you can still activate its effect at the End of the Damage Step.

<p>
  Also if an attack progresses until the Damage Step, that attacking monster is treated as "having attacked"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
  >.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    An attack was declared with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83531441">"Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"</span> on an opponent's monster and the attack progressed until the Damage Step. Afterwards, even if the opponent's monster disappears and damage calculation is not performed, the effect that says "If this card attacks, it is changed to Defense Position at the end of the Battle Phase" is applied at the end of the Battle Phase.
