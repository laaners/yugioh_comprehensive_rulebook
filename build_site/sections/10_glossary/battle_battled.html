<h2>Battle/Battled</h2>
<p>A monster "battles" (and is "battling") starting from when it attacks or is attacked. This includes both monsters attacking other monsters, and monsters attacking a player's Life Points directly.</p>
<p>
  When a card requires a monster to have "battled" (past tense), the attack had to have reached the damage calculation portion of the Damage Step in order for the monster to have "battled". If the attack stops before damage calculation, the monster did not "battle". (Note that
  <strong>an attack was still declared</strong>, however, so in most cases the attacking monster cannot declare another attack).
