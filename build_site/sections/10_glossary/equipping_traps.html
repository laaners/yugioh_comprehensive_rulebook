<ul>
  <li>Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13317419">"Rocket Hand"</span> that equip themselves to a monster after activation are Normal Trap Cards that remain on the field after activation. After they become Equip Cards, they are also treated as Trap Cards. <strong>They have every other rule that Equip Spell Cards have</strong>.</li>
