    If you activate a Field Spell Card (1) using the effect of another card (2), the activation of (1) will also be performed while (2) is resolving. No Chain Link is formed as a result of the (1)'s activation. If you activate (1) this way, you cannot apply (1)'s "when this card is activated" effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If you activate a Field Spell Card using the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89208725">"Metaverse"</span>, the activation of the Field Spell Card will also be performed while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89208725">"Metaverse"</span> is resolving. No Chain Link is formed as a result of the Field Spell Card's activation. If you activate a Field Spell this way, you cannot apply that Field Spell's "when this card is activated" effect.

    To activate [X] through another card effect you must still meet [X]'s activation requirements<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6909330">"Soul Binding Gate"</span> can be activated with the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89208725">"Metaverse"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48934760">"Demise of the Land"</span>, but you must still meet its requirements of controlling no monsters and Set Spell/Trap you control being destroyed by card effect this turn. Therefore, if you control no monsters and a Set Spell/Trap you control was destroyed by card effect this turn, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6909330">"Soul Binding Gate"</span> with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89208725">"Metaverse"</span>. Also, when the opponent Special Summons a monster(s) during a turn in which a Set Spell/Trap you control was destroyed by card effect, and you control no monsters, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6909330">"Soul Binding Gate"</span> with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48934760">"Demise of the Land"</span>'s effect.

    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      When your opponent activates the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58984738">"Dinomight Knight, the True Dracofighter"</span>, they activate a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="35125879">"True King's Return"</span> in the Spell & Trap Zone that is in the same column as your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="32841045">"Magical Musketeer Caspar"</span>. At this time, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="32841045">"Magical Musketeer Caspar"</span> that adds a "Magical Musket" card from your Deck to your hand cannot be activated.
