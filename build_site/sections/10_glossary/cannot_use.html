<p>Currently, only these two cards have this kind of effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    "Using" a card means the following actions:
    <ul>
      <li>Activating a Spell or Trap Card, Setting them from the hand or Deck, activating or applying the effects of Spells or Traps.</li>
      <li>Normal Summoning/Setting monsters, Special Summoning Special Summon Monsters by their requirements, activating the effects of monsters, using a monster as a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link Material, declaring an attack/changing its battle position.</li>
      <li>Activating a Pendulum Monster as a Spell Card. Also, activating or applying Pendulum Effects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A prohibited monster cannot be Special Summoned by the effects of other cards.</li>
  <li>If a Fusion Monster or Ritual Monster is prohibited, since Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are treated as using the card, they cannot be performed.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you can do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sending a prohibited card to the Graveyard or Tributing it as a cost is not treated as using it.</li>
  <li>Targeting a prohibited card or affecting it with the effects of another card is not treated as using it.</li>
  <li>Applying written clauses in the Effect Text that are not Monster Effects is not treated as using the card.</li>
  <li>If a prohibited Attack Position monster is attacked by the opponent, damage calculation is performed normally, and if the ATK of the opponent's monster is lower than the ATK of your monster, that monster is destroyed in battle.</li>
</ul>
