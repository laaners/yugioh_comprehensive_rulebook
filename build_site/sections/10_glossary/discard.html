    Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<h3>Costs that Discard</h3>

<p>Reminder of costs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Costs must be performed at the time the card is activated, and even if the activation or effect of the card is negated, they are not refunded<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the player cannot suffice the costs, they cannot activate the card<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Costs are not treated as card effects<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, costs can only be paid with cards in your possession<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost)<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
