    Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards that are discarded from the hand to the Graveyard are treated as cards that were discarded as well as cards that were sent from the hand to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards that are discarded are not treated as being destroyed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is activated, so that cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, discarded cards are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
