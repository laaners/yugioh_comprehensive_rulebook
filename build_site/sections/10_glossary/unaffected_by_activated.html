      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent controls a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span>, and its effect that makes it unaffected by my activated effects is applying.<br />I control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89631139">"Blue-Eyes White Dragon"</span>, to which the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span> has been applied, causing any monster it battles to be destroyed at the End of the Damage Step.<br />If the two monsters battle, what happens?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In this case, you receive 2000 points of Battle Damage when damage calculation is conducted, which is the difference between the monsters' ATK. Then, after damage calculation, the opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span> is destroyed.<br />(TL note: The Q&amp;A says "after damage calculation", but <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span> destroys the monster at End of the Damage Step. This is likely an oversight.)<br /><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span> is unaffected by any effect applied while resolving a Chain Link resulting from an opponent's activation, as long as its own effect is applying at that time. However, here, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span> is not applied to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span> while resolving a Chain Link.<br />Here, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span> that destroys an opponent's monster that battles your targeted monster is not an effect that applies while resolving the Chain Link formed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span>'s activation. Instead, it is an effect that applies later, at the End of the Damage Step, when the monster that was targeted by the effect battles. Therefore, it can destroy a monster that is unaffected by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span>'s activated effect.
