    Monsters which are "unaffected by activated effects" will be unaffected by any effect that is applied when the Chain Link formed by an activation resolves. However, any other effect will apply to them normally<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    Continuous/lingering effects that begin applying when the Chain Link formed by the card activation resolves, these effects will continue to apply to monsters afterwards. Therefore, these effects can affect monsters that are "unaffected by activated effects"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      The effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83326048">"Dimensional Barrier"</span> will negate the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span>, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36975314">"Crackdown"</span> will take control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span>.

    Effects that apply at a later point can affect monsters that are "unaffected by activated effects"<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      Your opponent controls a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span>, and its effect that makes it unaffected by your activated effects is applying. You control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89631139">"Blue-Eyes White Dragon"</span>, to which the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span> has been applied, causing any monster it battles to be destroyed at the End of the Damage Step. If the two monsters battle, you receive 2000 points of Battle Damage when damage calculation is conducted, which is the difference between the monsters' ATK. Then, at the End of the Damage Step, the opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span> is destroyed. Here, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span> that destroys an opponent's monster that battles your targeted monster is not an effect that applies while resolving the Chain Link formed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span>'s activation. Instead, it is an effect that applies later, at the End of the Damage Step, when the monster that was targeted by the effect battles. Therefore, it can destroy a monster that is unaffected by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56920308">"The Ultimate Creature of Destruction"</span>'s activated effect.
