    These are continuous effects that apply [B] at chain link resolution everytime [A] happens<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your opponent activates a card or effect, but you chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26708437">"Xyz Reborn"</span> and Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44405066">"Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"</span> from your Graveyard. The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44405066">"Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"</span> applies each time your opponent activates a card or effect while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44405066">"Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"</span> has Xyz Material, and inflicts damage after that card or effect resolves. Therefore, in this situation, if your opponent activates a card or effect while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44405066">"Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"</span> with Xyz Material is not present on your side of the field, the effect to inflict damage does not apply<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94192409">"Compulsory Evacuation Device"</span> is activated targeting your face-up <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64752646">"Fire Princess"</span>, and you chain <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53046408">"Emergency Provisions"</span> by sending any number of Spell/Trap Cards you control to the Graveyard, when the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53046408">"Emergency Provisions"</span> resolves at Chain Link 2, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64752646">"Fire Princess"</span> will apply to inflict 500 damage to your opponent. Then, then effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94192409">"Compulsory Evacuation Device"</span> at Chain Link 1 will be applied normally<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    These are effects that do not start a chain (no colon nor semicolon)<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
