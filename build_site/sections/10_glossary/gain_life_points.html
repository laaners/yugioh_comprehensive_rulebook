    Each player starts the duel with 8000 Life Points, but there is no upper limit to the life points a player can obtain. Even if you have 8000 Life Points, you can activate cards or effects that increase life points. The effect will resolve as usual, and the player will gain Life Points<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A card's effect which gains LP can be activated even if it will gain 0 LP and will resolve successfully<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="22011689">"Predaplant Moray Nepenthes"</span> is equipped with a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7268133">"Performapal Life Swordsman"</span> by its second effect. Even if that monster has 0 ATK, you can also activate the effect that destroys an equipped monster and increases your Life Points by its ATK. In this case, the equipped monster is destroyed normally, but you gain no Life Points.
