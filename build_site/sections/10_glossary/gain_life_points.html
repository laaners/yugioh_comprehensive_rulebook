<h3>0 LP gain and Activation Legality</h3>
<p>
  A card's effect which gains LP can be activated even if it will gain 0 LP and will resolve successfully.
  <br />
  Example: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="22011689">"Predaplant Moray Nepenthes"</span> is equipped with a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7268133">"Performapal Life Swordsman"</span> by its second effect. Even if that monster has 0 ATK, you can also activate the effect that destroys an equipped monster and increases your Life Points by its ATK. In this case, the equipped monster is destroyed normally, but you gain no Life Points.
