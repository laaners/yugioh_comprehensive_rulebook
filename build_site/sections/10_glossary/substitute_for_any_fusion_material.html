      <u>Question:</u><br />If I use monsters in the Deck, or banished monsters, as Fusion Material, can I apply the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79109599">"King of the Swamp"</span> that lets me substitute it for any 1 Fusion Material whose name is specifically listed on the Fusion Monster?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79109599">"King of the Swamp"</span> is in your Deck, or is banished, this effect cannot be applied. (You cannot substitute it for a specifically listed Fusion Material.)<br />This also applies to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53493204">"Goddess with the Third Eye"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50259460">"Versago the Destroyer"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15717011">"The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="52101615">"The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion"</span>, and other cards like them.

<h3>Substitute for any 1 Fusion Material and Fusion Summoning a Fusion Monster that lists [card name] as material</h3>
<p>
  If a card "Fusion Summons a Fusion Monster that lists [card name] as material", it must use a material requirement that meets [card name], and must also use a monster that meets [card name] to meet that specific requirement.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    You control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53493204">"Goddess with the Third Eye"</span> (LIGHT) and a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="68468459">"Fallen of Albaz"</span> (DARK). When you resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44362883">"Branded Fusion"</span>, you can't Fusion Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70534340">"Lubellion the Searing Dragon"</span>, which lists "1 DARK monster + "Fallen of Albaz"" as the necessary materials. The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53493204">"Goddess with the Third Eye"</span> allows it to substitute for a Fusion Material, but does not change its name.
