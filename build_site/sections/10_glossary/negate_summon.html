    If a Normal Summon is performed, a card that "negates the Normal Summon" can be used in response to that Normal Summon. Even if the Normal Summon is negated, in most cases you cannot perform another Normal Summon/Set<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A monster that has its Normal Summon/Set negated is sent to the Graveyard providing no particular effect is being applied. In that case, that monster is not treated as being sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a monster that does not have its Normal Summon/Set negated is placed on the field, this is called a "successful Normal Summon(/Set)"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Tributes are performed at the time the Tribute Summon is declared, before the monster that would be Normal Summoned/Set is placed on the field. Even if the Tribute Summon is negated, the Tributed monsters are sent to the Graveyard normally<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Special Summon is performed by meeting requirements, a card that "negates Special Summons" can be activated in response to that Special Summon<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the Special Summon is not negated, placing the monster on the field constitutes a "successful Special Summon"<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup

      <li>
        A monster that has its Special Summon negated is sent to the Graveyard providing no particular effect is being applied. In that case, the monster that was sent to the Graveyard is not considered to be sent from the hand, field, or Extra Deck to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even if the Flip Summon of a properly summoned Special Summon Monster is negated, that monster will still be treated as having been properly summoned<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup

      <li>
        When a Special Summon is performed as a result of the resolution of an activated effect that started a chain, if the activation of the activated effect that started a chain is not negated, the resolution that performs the Special Summon cannot be negated<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup

          After the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10194329">"Raidraptor - Avenge Vulture"</span> that says "If you take damage: You can Special Summon this card from your hand" was activated, cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> cannot be activated to negate the Special Summon when the effect is resolving. Afterwards, cards that respond to when a Special Summon is successful can be activated when the Special Summon is successful.

    An effect that activates when used for a Special Summon material (for example used for a Link Summon material or a Synchro Summon material) cannot be activated if the Summon is negated<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If I Tribute <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76722334">"Capshell"</span> as a cost for a Tribute Summon, and that Tribute Summon is negated, can I activate its effect to draw 1 card?<br />Also, if the Synchro or Link Summon of a monster that used <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76722334">"Capshell"</span> as material was negated, can I use its effect to draw 1 card?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Even if the Tribute Summon that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76722334">"Capshell"</span> was Tributed for is negated, its effect can be activated since it was Tributed.<br />If the Synchro or Link Summon that used <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76722334">"Capshell"</span> as material was negated, it is not treated as being used as material for a Synchro or Link Summon, so its effect cannot activate.

    During an attempt to Normal or Special Summon a monster from a location outside the field, the monster is not yet on the field. If the Summon of the monster is negated, then the monster is never considered to have been on the field. On the other hand, during an attempt to Flip Summoned or Normal Summoned again (Gemini monsters) a monster already on the field, the monster is considered to be on the field<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> is activated during an attempt to Normal, Flip or Special Summon a monster, can <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98956134">"Destruction Jammer"</span> be activated in response?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> is activated during an attempt to Normal or Special Summon a monster, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98956134">"Destruction Jammer"</span> cannot be activated in response. (Since the monster to be destroyed is not yet on the field, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> is not considered to be an effect that destroys cards on the field.)<br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> is activated during an attempt to Flip Summon, or an attempt to Normal Summon a Gemini Monster again, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98956134">"Destruction Jammer"</span> can be activated in response. (In these cases, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span> is considered to be an effect that destroys cards on the field.)

<h3>Pendulum Monsters</h3>
<p>Pendulum Monsters sent from outside the field to the Graveyard are sent to the Graveyard normally. For example, if at the time you would Normal Summon a Pendulum Monster from the hand that itself is negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41420027">"Solemn Judgment"</span>, the Pendulum Monster that is not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard is not added to the Extra Deck, and is sent to the Graveyard.</p>
