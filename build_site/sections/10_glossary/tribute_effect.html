<h3>Tributes of a Ritual</h3>
<p>Tributes for a ritual are sent to the Graveyard as a result of the effect of the Ritual Spell Card.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the activation of the Ritual Spell Card is negated, since the resolution is not performed, the Tributing is not performed either.</li>
  <li>Unless stated otherwise, you can only Tribute monsters in your possession.</li>
  <li>If the Ritual Spell says "whose total Levels equal [X]", you must Tribute monsters so that the sum of the Level matches that value exactly. Also, if "whose total Levels equal [X] or more" is written, the sum does not need to be exactly equal as long as it is equal or more.</li>
  <li>
    The number of Tributed monsters cannot be higher than necessary.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30392583">"Prediction Ritual"</span> is activated and its effect that says "You must also Tribute monsters from your hand or field whose total Levels equal 9 or more" resolves, you cannot Tribute a Level 9 and a Level 2 monster, as the Levels already add up to 9 or more with only 1 monster. You can Tribute a Level 5 and a Level 6 monster.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>Monster Tokens on the field can also be Tributed. In that case, Tokens that would be sent to the Graveyard are removed from the Duel.</li>
  <li>Since Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters do not have a Level, they cannot be used for the tributes of a Ritual Summon.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be tributed. In that case, the Tributed Trap Cards are sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>The Tributes for the Ritual Summon are Tributed by an effect, but afterwards the Ritual Summon is performed. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can do [effect]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure.</li>
