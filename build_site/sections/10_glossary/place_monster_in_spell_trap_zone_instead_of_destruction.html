        <p>When this card is Special Summoned: You can Special Summon as many "Crystal Beast" Monster Cards as possible from your Spell & Trap Zones. If this face-up card is destroyed in a Monster Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.</p>

        <strong>Wedju Temple</strong>
        <p>During your Main Phase: You can place 1 monster from your hand in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell, then place 1 "Millennium" monster from your Deck in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell. You can only use this effect of "Wedju Temple" once per turn. If a face-up "Millennium" monster(s) you control is destroyed by battle or card effect, you can place it in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.</p>

        <p>Special Summon this card as an Effect Monster (Rock-Type/LIGHT/Level 4/ATK 1000/DEF 1800). (This card is also still a Trap Card.) While this card is an Effect Monster, if another Trap Card you control that is a monster would be destroyed by your opponent's card (either by battle or by card effect) and sent to your Graveyard, you can Set it in the Spell & Trap Card Zone instead.</p>
