<h3>Monsters with a certain property being Summoned, and then losing that property before Trigger effects are checked for</h3>
<p>Example: while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> is face-up on the field, Skill Drain is activated, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> resolves in response, Special Summoning Harpie Queen. At the time that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span>, its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". Afterwards, when the effect of Skill Drain applies, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is negated, and its name returns to being "Harpie Queen". Regardless, a "Harpie Lady" or "Harpie Lady Sisters" has been Special Summoned to the field, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> must be activated.</p>
