          This card's name becomes "Gunkan Suship Shari" while in the hand, Deck, GY, or on the field. You can only use the following effect of "Gunkan Suship Shari Red" once per turn. You can reveal 1 other "Gunkan Suship Shari" in your hand; Special Summon this card from your hand, then you can apply this effect.<br />
          ‚óè Special Summon 1 "Gunkan" monster from your Deck, except "Gunkan Suship Shari", but negate its effects (if any), then, Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 Xyz Monster that mentions that Special Summoned monster's name, using that monster and this card as material.

<h3>Cannot Summon: Summon restrictions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A card (1) with the restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon except X monsters the turn you activate this card" applies its restrictions for the entire duration of the turn. Normally, if you Summon a monster (2) which violates the restriction of (1), then (1) cannot be activated. Similarly, if you activate (1) first (2) cannot be Summoned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. But if:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), then (1) can be activated <strong>after</strong> (2) has been Summoned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), but you activate (1) <strong>before</strong> (2) is Summoned, then (2) cannot be Summoned anymore<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56769674">"A DNA Transplant"</span> that was activated by declaring the LIGHT Attribute is face-up on the field. In this situation, I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83764719">"Monster Reborn"</span> and Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11260714">"Darklord Superbia"</span> from my Graveyard, then activate its effect and Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3395226">"Mozarta the Melodious Maestra"</span> from the Graveyard:
      <ul>
        <li>Even if you Special Summoned a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11260714">"Darklord Superbia"</span> (whose original Attribute is DARK) this turn, if you did so while the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56769674">"A DNA Transplant"</span> was applying declaring LIGHT, you can activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3395226">"Mozarta the Melodious Maestra"</span>.</li>
        <li>However, if you first activated the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3395226">"Mozarta the Melodious Maestra"</span>, you cannot Special Summon monsters whose original Attributes are anything other than LIGHT, even if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56769674">"A DNA Transplant"</span> is applying.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    An effect (1) is applying so that monsters with a certain specific property X cannot be summoned, but monsters with another specific property Y can be summoned. A monster (2)'s has X property, so (2) can't be summoned due to (1). If (2) has an effect that says "summon this card as a monster with Y property", then (2) can be summoned through that effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      Your opponent controls <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="91279700">"Evilswarm Ophion"</span>, which has materials attached and is applying its effect "Level 5 or higher monsters cannot be Special Summoned". <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42338879">"Cockadoodledoo"</span> has effects that say "you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) as a Level 3 monster" or "you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) as a Level 4 monster", so you can Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42338879">"Cockadoodledoo"</span> using either of its effects.

<h3>Immediately after this effect resolves ... Summon</h3>
<p>An effect (1) is applying that changes properties of monsters face-up on the field.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can activate an effect (2) that summons back monsters (3) from a location (like the Graveyard) to the field and immediately after at resolution performs a Special Summon of a monster (4), as long as (3) and their properties satisfied the summoning requirements for (4) when (3) were in their original location (like the Graveyard).</li>
  <li>But when (3) are summoned back to the field, as (1) is applying, if (1) changes (3)'s properties so that you can't summon (4) at resolution anymore, you must summon another monster that can be summoned with (3) after their properties have changed from the same location(s) of (4).</li>
  <li>If there are no monsters that can be summoned from the location(s) of (4), after summoning back (3), (2) resolves without performing the Special Summon.</li>
</ul>

  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81489939">"Stygian Dirge"</span> is face-up on the field. You can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29087919">"Geargia Change"</span> targeting "Geargiano" monsters that are Level 3 in your Graveyard, as long as you are able to Xyz Summon a Rank 3 monster using the targeted monsters. In this scenario, since the Levels of the targeted monsters are reduced by 1 after being Special Summoned, you cannot Xyz Summon a Rank 3 monster, and you must instead Xyz Summon a Rank 2 monster if one exists in your Extra Deck. At this time, if you do not have a Rank 2 monster in your Extra Deck, the Xyz Summon is not performed.

<h3>Negate Effects</h3>
<p>
  When a monster's effects that gained the Level, name or effect of another monster are negated, then only the Level will return to its original value.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58446973">"Infernoid Decatron"</span> was activated, gaining the name and effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88301393">"Infernoid Attondel"</span> and increasing its Level by 8. Afterwards if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58446973">"Infernoid Decatron"</span> has its effects negated by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> being activated. In the proposed scenario, the Level of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58446973">"Infernoid Decatron"</span> that was increased by 8 returns to the original value, but the gained name remains as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88301393">"Infernoid Attondel"</span>. Also, the gained effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88301393">"Infernoid Attondel"</span> remain gained, but they are negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>.

<h3>Monsters with a certain property being Summoned, and then losing that property before Trigger effects are checked for</h3>
<p>Example: while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> is face-up on the field, Skill Drain is activated, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> resolves in response, Special Summoning Harpie Queen. At the time that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span>, its name is treated as "Harpie Lady". Afterwards, when the effect of Skill Drain applies, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75064463">"Harpie Queen"</span> is negated, and its name returns to being "Harpie Queen". Regardless, a "Harpie Lady" or "Harpie Lady Sisters" has been Special Summoned to the field, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75782277">"Harpies' Hunting Ground"</span> must be activated.</p>

<h3>Monsters with multiple attributes count for all their attributes when used as material.</h3>
<p>A monster (1) who gains different effects based on the materials used for its Summon, if one (2) of the materials had an effect on the field that treated its attribute as multiple attributes, then (1) will gain all the respective effects based on the multiple attributes of (2).</p>
