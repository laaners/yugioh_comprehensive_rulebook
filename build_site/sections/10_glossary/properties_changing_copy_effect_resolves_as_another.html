    Copying activated effects and named once per turn restrictions: this kind of effect "ignores" named once per turn restrictions.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      You can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span> by banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51124303">"Nekroz Kaleidoscope"</span> during a turn in which the Ritual Summoning effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51124303">"Nekroz Kaleidoscope"</span> has been used. While resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span>, the effect of the banished Ritual Spell Card is performed as the resolution of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span>. Therefore, even in that case, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span> can be activated by banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51124303">"Nekroz Kaleidoscope"</span>.

    A card (1) copies the effect of another card (2) and applies the effects of (2) at resolution: the effect it's still treated as (1)'s name effect.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span> by sending <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span> to the Graveyard, you cannot Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11020863">"Royal Straight Slasher"</span>. When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span> resolves, the sent Spell's effect is applied as the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span>. Therefore, the Special Summoned monster would be considered to have been Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span>, not by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span>. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11020863">"Royal Straight Slasher"</span>, which must be Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span>, cannot be Special Summoned.
