    You activate a card (1) that says "You can only apply this effect of [card name] once per Duel". As Chain Link 2 you activate a card (2) that copies the effect of (1). The chain resolves backwards, (2) resolves as (1)'s effect and (1) resolves without applying its effect since you can only apply (1)'s effect once per Duel<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49398568">"Serial Spell"</span> can be activated in a Chain to the activation of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="57734012">"Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One"</span>. In that case, when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49398568">"Serial Spell"</span> resolves, you will Special Summon 1 monster that has a number between <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48739166">"Number 101"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88177324">"Number 107"</span> in its name, except a "Number C" monster, then Special Summon 1 "Number C" monster with the same number by overlaying it on the first monster and using it as material. After that, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="57734012">"Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One"</span> resolves without Special Summoning any monsters. You can only perform the Special Summons from the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="57734012">"Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One"</span> once per Duel.

    A card (1) copies the effect of another card (2) and applies the effects of (2) at resolution: the effect it's still treated as (1)'s name effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span> by sending <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span> to the Graveyard, you cannot Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11020863">"Royal Straight Slasher"</span>. When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span> resolves, the sent Spell's effect is applied as the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span>. Therefore, the Special Summoned monster would be considered to have been Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span>, not by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span>. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11020863">"Royal Straight Slasher"</span>, which must be Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span>, cannot be Special Summoned.

    If a card (1) says "do [A] at/until [X] turn after this card's activation" ("keeps track" of when (1) was activated), (1)'s effect cannot be copied by <b>activating an effect</b> that copies effects such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s Graveyard effect. However, it can be copied by <b>activating a card</b> that copies effects such as by activating a set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      If it is currently either player's Main Phase, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79766336">"Trap of Darkness"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="22628574">"Fake Feather"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95676943">"Extinction on Schedule"</span>. If you do, at the end of the third Battle Phase after the respective card was activated, each player must send all cards on their field to the Graveyard normally. However, you cannot activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s Graveyard effect by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95676943">"Extinction on Schedule"</span>, and cannot activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58242947">"Junk Collector"</span>'s effect by banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95676943">"Extinction on Schedule"</span>.
