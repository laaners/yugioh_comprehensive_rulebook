      <u>Question:</u><br />This question is regarding the first and second effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>, both of which become a targeted Trap Card's effect when they resolve.<br />Ⓐ: According to the text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38960450">"Armory Call"</span>, "You can only activate 1 "<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38960450">"Armory Call"</span>" per turn." If I have previously activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38960450">"Armory Call"</span> this turn, can I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38960450">"Armory Call"</span>?<br />Ⓑ: If I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span>, what happens to the "You cannot conduct your Battle Phase the turn you activate this card." limitation imposed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span>'s text?<br />Ⓒ: If I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43986064">"Giant Starfall"</span>, does "Neither player can activate the effects of monsters without a Level in response to this card's activation." apply?<br />Ⓓ: If it is not currently the End Step of the Battle Phase, can I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span>, which has the "At the end of the Battle Phase, (...)" activation condition?<br />Ⓔ: If I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20612097">"Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine"</span>, does the "For the rest of this turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon monsters, except Zombie monsters." effect apply?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />With regard to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s first effect, you can disregard any "once per turn" restrictions listed on the original Normal Trap being targeted. Additionally, if that Normal Trap requires a cost to be paid, that cost can also be ignored. However, any activation conditions of the Normal Trap being targeted must still be met. (This also applies to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79766336">"Trap of Darkness"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="22628574">"Fake Feather"</span>, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="68779682">"Labrynth Barrage"</span>.)<br />Similarly, with regard to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s second effect, you can also disregard any "once per turn" restrictions, and any costs, listed on the original Normal Trap being targeted. Additionally, since activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s second effect is not activating a Trap Card, you can ignore any activation conditions and other restrictions that only apply when activating a Trap Card. However, you still need to meet any activation conditions for activating that card's effect. (This also applies to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58242947">"Junk Collector"</span>'s effect.)<br />Finally, when resolving the first or second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>, generally speaking, the entire effect that is listed as the effect of resolving the targeted card's Card activation is applied. However, if any parts of the effect require a Trap Card to have been activated, such as if "For the rest of this turn after this card resolves, (...)" is specified, those parts are only applied if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> itself was activated (i.e., its first effect is resolving), but are not applied if this is not the case (i.e., <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s second effect is resolving).<br />Ⓐ: You can activate either of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s effects by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38960450">"Armory Call"</span>, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38960450">"Armory Call"</span> was previously activated this turn. As mentioned previously, you can disregard the "You can only activate 1 "<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38960450">"Armory Call"</span>" per turn." text.<br />Ⓑ: The "You cannot conduct your Battle Phase the turn you activate this card." text is a limitation on <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span>'s Trap Card activation. Therefore, you need to follow it if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span> is targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s first effect. (You cannot target <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span> if the Battle Phase was conducted this turn, and cannot conduct the Battle Phase if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span> was previously targeted.) However, you can ignore this limitation if targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23924608">"Heavy Storm Duster"</span> for <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s second effect.<br />Ⓒ: The "Neither player can activate the effects of monsters without a Level in response to this card's activation." text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43986064">"Giant Starfall"</span> is neither an activation requirement, nor part of its effect's resolution. Therefore, it is not considered when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43986064">"Giant Starfall"</span> is targeted by the first or second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>. (Players are allowed to activate the effects of monsters without a Level in response to the activation of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>, or its effect.)<br />Ⓓ: You cannot activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>, or its effect, by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span> in the situation given. Both "at the end of the Battle Phase" and "if your opponent controls more cards than you do" are activation conditions for activating <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span>'s effect. Therefore, both requirements must be met if either <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>, or its effect, is activated by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span>.<br />Ⓔ: The "For the rest of this turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon monsters, except Zombie monsters." effect is applied as part of the effect applied during the resolution of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20612097">"Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine"</span>'s Card activation. However, it only applies if a Card was activated. Therefore, it will only be applied if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span> was activated (and its first effect is now resolving), but will not be applied if only <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="6351147">"Transaction Rollback"</span>'s (second) effect was activated (and is now resolving).
