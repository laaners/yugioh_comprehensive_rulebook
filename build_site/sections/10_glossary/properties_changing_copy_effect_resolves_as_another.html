      <summary>Example</summary>
      You can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span> by banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51124303">"Nekroz Kaleidoscope"</span> during a turn in which the Ritual Summoning effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51124303">"Nekroz Kaleidoscope"</span> has been used. While resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span>, the effect of the banished Ritual Spell Card is performed as the resolution of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span>. Therefore, even in that case, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38844957">"Urgent Ritual Art"</span> can be activated by banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51124303">"Nekroz Kaleidoscope"</span>.

    You activate a card (1) that says "You can only apply this effect of [card name] once per Duel". As Chain Link 2 you activate a card (2) that copies the effect of (1). The chain resolves backwards, (2) resolves as (1)'s effect and (1) resolves without applying its effect since you can only apply (1)'s effect once per Duel<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49398568">"Serial Spell"</span> can be activated in a Chain to the activation of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="57734012">"Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One"</span>. In that case, when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49398568">"Serial Spell"</span> resolves, you will Special Summon 1 monster that has a number between <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48739166">"Number 101"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88177324">"Number 107"</span> in its name, except a "Number C" monster, then Special Summon 1 "Number C" monster with the same number by overlaying it on the first monster and using it as material. After that, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="57734012">"Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One"</span> resolves without Special Summoning any monsters. You can only perform the Special Summons from the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="57734012">"Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One"</span> once per Duel.

    A card (1) copies the effect of another card (2) and applies the effects of (2) at resolution: the effect it's still treated as (1)'s name effect<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If you activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span> by sending <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span> to the Graveyard, you cannot Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11020863">"Royal Straight Slasher"</span>. When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span> resolves, the sent Spell's effect is applied as the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span>. Therefore, the Special Summoned monster would be considered to have been Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81945678">"Joker's Wild"</span>, not by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span>. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11020863">"Royal Straight Slasher"</span>, which must be Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58415502">"Royal Straight"</span>, cannot be Special Summoned.
