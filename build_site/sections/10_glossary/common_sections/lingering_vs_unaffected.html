In this situation, if my opponent uses <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27243130">"Forbidden Lance"</span> to make their <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49885567">"Spiritual Beast Cannahawk"</span> unaffected by Spell/Trap effects, and then activates its effect that banishes a "Ritual Beast" card from the Deck, will that effect be negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87639778">"Harpie's Feather Storm"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />As in this scenario, when a monster on your opponent's field activates its effect, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87639778">"Harpie's Feather Storm"</span> is treated as an effect that is applied to that monster. Therefore, the effect of your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49885567">"Spiritual Beast Cannahawk"</span>, which is unaffected by Spell/Trap effects, is not negated and resolves normally.
