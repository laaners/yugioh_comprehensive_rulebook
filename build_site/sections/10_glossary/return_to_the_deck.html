<ul>
  <li>If cards are returned to the Deck, that card is added face-down to the Deck and is shuffled. However, if a card is returned to a specified location like the top or bottom of the Deck, the shuffling is not performed.</li>
  <li>
    If, at the timing a card effect can be activated, that card has been returned to the Deck, in most cases that effect cannot be activated.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> has been discarded as a cost to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="60743819">"Fiend Griefing"</span> that says "Target 1 monster in your opponent's Graveyard; shuffle it into the Deck," is activated in a chain, so that the discarded <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> is returned to the Deck, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15341821">"Dandylion"</span> does not activate.
