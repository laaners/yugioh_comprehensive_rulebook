    If cards are returned to the Deck, that card is added face-down to the Deck and is shuffled. However, if a card is returned to a specified location like the top or bottom of the Deck, the shuffling is not performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If, at the timing a card effect can be activated, that card has been returned to the Deck, in most cases that effect cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that return/shuffle a monster to the Deck can be applied on Extra Deck monsters like a Fusion Monster. In that case, the monster is not returned/shuffled to the Main Deck and is returned to the Extra Deck instead. Furthermore, in that case, since no cards were returned to the Deck, the Deck is not shuffled. This action is not treated as returning/adding a monster to the deck<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.

      <u>Question:</u><br />If I activate
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64014615">"Pot of Acquisitiveness"</span>
      by targeting a total of 3 banished Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link Monsters, how does it resolve?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If you activate
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64014615">"Pot of Acquisitiveness"</span>
      by targeting a total of 3 banished Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link Monsters, those monsters are returned to the Extra Deck instead of the Main Deck. Note that since no cards were returned to the Main Deck, it is not shuffled. After that, you will still draw 1 card normally.

    An activating Quick-Play Spell Card (1) cannot be returned to the Deck by an effect (2) in chain, in both cases when (1) is a Chain Link lower than (2) or vice versa: (1) is not a legal target for (2)<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent has 1 Set card in their Spell &amp; Trap Zone.<br />In this situation, I Ritual Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25415052">"Shinobaroness Peacock"</span>. I then activate its effect that returns up to 3 of my opponent's Spell/Trap Cards to the Deck, then Special Summons a Level 4 or lower Spirit monster from my Deck.<br />My opponent activates their Set card in response, which is a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>. How does the effect of
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25415052">"Shinobaroness Peacock"</span>
      resolve?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25415052">"Shinobaroness Peacock"</span>, a
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>
      that was activated in response cannot be returned to the Deck.<br />In this scenario, if there are no other Spell/Trap Cards on my opponent's field, you cannot apply the part of the effect that returns your opponent's Spell/Trap Cards to the Deck. As a result, you also cannot Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Spirit monster from your Deck.
