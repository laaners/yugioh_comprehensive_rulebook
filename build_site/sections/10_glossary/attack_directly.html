    A monster's continuous effect says "while/if [condition] this card can attack your opponent directly". If it declares a direct attack, but something happens in the Battle Step such that [condition] is no longer satisfied, that monster can no longer attack directly with its own effect and a replay occurs (You can select a monster as the new attack target, or cancel the attack)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />While I have 2 cards in my Pendulum Zones with the same Pendulum Scales, I attack directly with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26638543">"Metrognome"</span> using its effect. During the Battle Step, if my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="69982329">"Pendulum Shift"</span> and changes the Pendulum Scale of a card in my Pendulum Zone, what happens to the attack?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In this scenario, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26638543">"Metrognome"</span> declares a direct attack using its own effect, but the Pendulum Scales of the cards in your Pendulum Zone are changed, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26638543">"Metrognome"</span> can no longer attack directly with its own effect and a replay occurs. (You can select a monster as the new attack target, or cancel the attack.)
