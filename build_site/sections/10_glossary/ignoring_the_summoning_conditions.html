    In order to Special Summon a Special Summon Monster from the Graveyard, even ignoring its Summoning Conditions, that monster must first have been Special Summoned properly, then sent to the Graveyard. The same applies to Special Summon Monsters that are in your Extra Deck face-up, banished face-up, Spell & Trap Zone and Pendulum Zone (public knowledge)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
