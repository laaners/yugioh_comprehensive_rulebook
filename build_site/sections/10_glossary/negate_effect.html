    If an effect that simply negates effects is activated in a chain to the activation of a card, the activation of the card is not negated and its effect is not applied afterwards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if the effect of an activated card is negated, that effect is negated but its resolution is still treated as being performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51452091">"Royal Decree"</span> that says "Negate all other Trap Card effects on the field." is being applied, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is activated by discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> as a cost, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is negated, but since the timing is treated as that effect being resolved, the effect of the discarded <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> that says "When this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated.

  <li>
    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "its effects are negated" effect can primarily be applied to Effect Monsters whose effects are not yet negated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If the targeted monster's effects are already negated when resolving <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="43685562">"Joruri-P.U.N.K. Dangerous Gabu"</span>, what happens?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In that case, the monster's effects cannot be negated until the end of the turn. Therefore, you also do not gain Life Points equal to that monster's original ATK.

    Effects negation can apply to Effect Monsters without any effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73417207">"Mara of the Nordic Alfar"</span><sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12817939">"Dark Lucius LV6"</span> that was Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85313220">"Dark Lucius LV4"</span> destroys an opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73417207">"Mara of the Nordic Alfar"</span> by battle, will its effect that negates the effects of monsters it destroys by battle be applied? Furthermore, during the Standby Phase of my next turn, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12817939">"Dark Lucius LV6"</span> that Special Summons a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58206034">"Dark Lucius LV8"</span> from my hand or Deck?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br /><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73417207">"Mara of the Nordic Alfar"</span> is an Effect Monster, even though it has no monster effects. Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12817939">"Dark Lucius LV6"</span> destroys an opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73417207">"Mara of the Nordic Alfar"</span> by battle, the effect that negates the effects of monsters it destroys by battle is applied normally.<br />Furthermore, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12817939">"Dark Lucius LV6"</span> that Special Summons a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="58206034">"Dark Lucius LV8"</span> can be activated during your next Standby Phase.
