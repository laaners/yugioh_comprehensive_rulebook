    If an effect that simply negates effects is activated in a chain to the activation of a card, the activation of the card is not negated and its effect is not applied afterwards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if the effect of an activated card is negated, that effect is negated but its resolution is still treated as being performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51452091">"Royal Decree"</span> that says "Negate all other Trap Card effects on the field." is being applied, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is activated by discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> as a cost, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is negated, but since the timing is treated as that effect being resolved, the effect of the discarded <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> that says "When this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated.

    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost) <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

<h3>Counters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    If counters that can only be placed on a particular card like itself are placed on a card that has its effects negated, those counters are removed.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40089744">"Gateway to Chaos"</span> that had Spell Counters placed on itself by its effect that says "Each time a Monster Card(s) is sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard, place 1 Spell Counter on this card for each of those cards" has its effects negated by an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37267041">"Silent Swordsman LV7"</span>, the Spell Counters are removed.

  </li>
  <li>
    If counters are placed on another card by an effect that places counters, even if the effects of that card are negated, the counters are not removed.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      Ice Counters placed by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73659078">"Snowdust Giant"</span> that says "reveal any number of WATER monsters from your hand, and place that many Ice Counters on face-up monsters on the field" are not removed if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="73659078">"Snowdust Giant"</span> has its effects negated.
