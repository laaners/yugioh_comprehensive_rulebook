    If an effect that simply negates effects is activated in a chain to the activation of a card, the activation of the card is not negated and its effect is not applied afterwards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if the effect of an activated card is negated, that effect is negated but its resolution is still treated as being performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51452091">"Royal Decree"</span> that says "Negate all other Trap Card effects on the field." is being applied, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is activated by discarding <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> as a cost, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> is negated, but since the timing is treated as that effect being resolved, the effect of the discarded <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50287060">"Archfiend of Gilfer"</span> that says "When this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; equip that target with this card." cannot be activated.

    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
