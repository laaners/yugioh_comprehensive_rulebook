<ul>
  <li>
    Trap Cards treated as Monster Cards which say they are not treated as a Trap Card, like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span>, are only treated as Monster Cards. As a result, they cannot be destroyed by effects that destroy Spell or Trap Cards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The original ATK of Traps treated as monsters is the value determined by the effect that summoned them<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    An effect (1) targets a Spell/Trap Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone. If another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone (and (2) is <b>not</b> treated as a Spell/Trap at resolution), then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully <sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: my opponent has activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> by targeting a Set The <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in my Spell & Trap Zone. If I now activate that<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in response, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> will first be Special Summoned when resolving its Trap Card. At this time, since it is no longer treated as a Trap Card, it also stops being targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>. Therefore, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>'s effect is then not applied.
