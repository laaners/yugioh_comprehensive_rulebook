      <u>Question:</u><br />In my Monster Zone, there are a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="8522996">"The First Monarch"</span> and a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="54241725">"The Prime Monarch"</span>, both of which were Special Summoned by their respective effects. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="8522996">"The First Monarch"</span> is also treated as a Trap, while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="54241725">"The Prime Monarch"</span> is not treated as a Trap.<br />In this situation, I resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85888377">"Apophis the Swamp Deity"</span>, and its effect allows me to negate cards my opponent controls, up to the number of other Continuous Traps I control. How many cards can I negate?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the situation described, you can only negate the effects of one card your opponent controls.<br />The <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="8522996">"The First Monarch"</span>, which was Special Summoned by its own effect, is treated both as a monster, and as a Continuous Trap Card, while in the Monster Zone.<br />On the other hand, the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="54241725">"The Prime Monarch"</span>, which was Special Summoned by its own effect, is treated as a monster while in the Monster Zone, but is not treated as a Continuous Trap Card.

    The original ATK of Traps treated as monsters is the value determined by the effect that summoned them<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    An effect (1) targets a Spell/Trap Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone. If another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone (and (2) is <b>not</b> treated as a Spell/Trap at resolution), then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent has activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> by targeting a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in my Spell &amp; Trap Zone. If I now activate that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in response, what happens when this Chain resolves?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the situation you describe, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> will first be Special Summoned when resolving its Trap Card activation and applying its first effect. At this time, since it is no longer treated as a Trap Card, it also stops being targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>. Therefore, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>'s effect is then not applied.<br />This also applies to the following Trap Cards, which also have effects that Special Summon them as a monster (without being treated as a Trap Card): <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74577599">"Traptrix Holeutea"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62645025">"The Phantom Knights of Wrong Magnetring"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36247316">"The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20447641">"Qlife's End"</span>, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51606429">"The Phantom Knights of Tomb Shield"</span>.
