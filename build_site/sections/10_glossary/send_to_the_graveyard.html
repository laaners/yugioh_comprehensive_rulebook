    A card can be sent to the Graveyard in various ways. Destroying a card, discarding, and Tributing a monster are all actions that send a card to the Graveyard, and will normally activate "When/If this card is sent to the Graveyard..." Trigger Effects<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards that are sent to the Graveyard are not treated as destroyed cards or Tributed cards<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If cards with an effect that prevents cards from being destroyed by effects is being applied, effects that send cards to the Graveyard are still applied<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards sent from the hand to the Graveyard are not treated as cards that are discarded from the hand<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82888408">"The Fabled Cerburrel"</span> (1) is sent to the Graveyard by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18175965">"Guardian Dreadscythe"</span> that says "Send 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard, and if you do, Special Summon this card from the Graveyard.", since (1) is not treated as being discarded from the hand, its effect that says "If this card is discarded to the Graveyard: Special Summon it" cannot be activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is activated, so that cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, cards are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If control of a card changes and it is sent to the Graveyard by the resolution of a card effect, that card is sent to the owner's Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
