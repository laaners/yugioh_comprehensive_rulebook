<h3>Costs that Send to the Graveyard</h3>

<p>Reminder of costs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Costs must be performed at the time the card is activated, and even if the activation or effect of the card is negated, they are not refunded<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the player cannot suffice the costs, they cannot activate the card<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Costs are not treated as card effects<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, costs can only be paid with cards in your possession<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For costs that read "send to the Graveyard;", those monsters must be sent to the Graveyard in order to activate the effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The monsters sent to the Graveyard are not treated as being destroyed.</li>
  <li>Cards sent from the hand to the Graveyard are not treated as being discarded from the hand.</li>
  <li>
    If a monster that would be sent to the Graveyard as a cost needs to meet certain requirements, a face-down monster on the field cannot be sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      A face-down Plant-Type monster cannot be sent to the Graveyard to activate the cost of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95239444">"Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter"</span>, which reads "You can send 1 Plant-Type monster from your hand or face-up from your side of the field to the Graveyard;".
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or similar is being applied, so that the cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished instead and so that it is not possible to send cards to the Graveyard, activations that send cards to the Graveyard as a cost cannot be performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since Token Monsters are removed from the duel when they leave the field, they cannot be sent to the Graveyard for texts that say "send to the Graveyard;"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
