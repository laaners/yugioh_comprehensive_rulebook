<ul>
  <li>If multiple cards are drawn, this is performed by taking cards in order from the top, but this is treated as drawing all cards simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Even if cards are drawn by a card effect during the Draw Phase, that drawing is not treated as the normal draw of the turn.</li>

  <li>If a player has 0 cards left in their Deck, that player cannot activate an optional effect that draws cards. Similarly, effects that draw multiple cards cannot be activated if it is not possible to draw that many cards. However, effects like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="22589918">"Reload"</span> that draw cards after adding cards to the Deck can be activated even if there are no cards in the Deck.</li>
  <li>If cards are sent from the Deck to the Graveyard during the resolution of a card, so that the player becomes unable to draw cards but is forced to by a mandatorily activated effect, that player loses the Duel.</li>
  <li>
    If cards from the Deck are added to the hand by an effect that does not draw cards but "adds them to the hand", this is not treated as drawing cards.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      If a card is added to the hand by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98645731">"Pot of Duality"</span> that says "Excavate the top 3 cards of your Deck, add 1 of them to your hand, also, after that, shuffle the rest back into your Deck.", this is not treated as drawing cards.
