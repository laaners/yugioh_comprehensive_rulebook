<h3>Property changing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A card (1) with the restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon except [...] monsters the turn you activate this card" applies its restrictions for the entire duration of the turn. Normally, if you Summon a monster (2) which violates the restriction of (1), then (1) cannot be activated. Similarly, if you activate (1) first (2) cannot be Summoned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. But if:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), then (1) can be activated <strong>after</strong> (2) has been Summoned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), but you activate (1) <strong>before</strong> (2) is Summoned, then (2) cannot be Summoned anymore<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Example: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56769674">"A DNA Transplant"</span> that was activated by declaring the LIGHT Attribute is face-up on the field. In this situation, I activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83764719">"Monster Reborn"</span> and Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11260714">"Darklord Superbia"</span> from my Graveyard, then activate its effect and Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3395226">"Mozarta the Melodious Maestra"</span> from the Graveyard:
    <ul>
      <li>Even if you Special Summoned a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="11260714">"Darklord Superbia"</span> (whose original Attribute is DARK) this turn, if you did so while the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56769674">"A DNA Transplant"</span> was applying declaring LIGHT, you can activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3395226">"Mozarta the Melodious Maestra"</span>.</li>
      <li>However, if you first activated the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3395226">"Mozarta the Melodious Maestra"</span>, you cannot Special Summon monsters whose original Attributes are anything other than LIGHT, even if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56769674">"A DNA Transplant"</span> is applying.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    An effect (1) is applying so that a group of monsters with a certain specific property X cannot be summoned, but monsters with another specific property Y can be summoned. A monster (2)'s has X property, so (2) can't be summoned due to (1). If (2) has an effect that says "summon this card as a monster with Y property", then (2) can be summoned through that effect<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: my opponent controls <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="91279700">"Evilswarm Ophion"</span>, which has materials attached and is applying its effect "Level 5 or higher monsters cannot be Special Summoned". <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42338879">"Cockadoodledoo"</span> has effects that say "you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) as a Level 3 monster" or "you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) as a Level 4 monster", so can Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42338879">"Cockadoodledoo"</span> using either of its effects.
  </li>
</ul>
