          Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can detach 1 material from this card; Special Summon 1 "Frog" monster from your Deck. Once per turn, when your opponent activates a Spell/Trap Card, or monster effect (Quick Effect): You can send 1 Aqua monster from your hand or face-up field to the GY; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card, then you can Set it to your field. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 WATER monster in your GY; add it to your hand.

    Effects that negate the activations of <strong>Spell/Trap</strong> Cards can negate the activation of the card by activating when those cards that would be negated are placed face-up on the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      If the opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>, you pass priority to activate cards, and the opponent activates another card in a chain, you cannot activate a card that negates the activations of Spell Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77414722">"Magic Jammer"</span> to negate the activation of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>.

<h3>Pendulum Monsters</h3>
<p>If Pendulum Monsters are placed in the Pendulum Zone, this is treated as the activation of a Spell Card. If their activation is negated by the effect of a card that negates the activation of Spells, since they are not treated as being sent from the field to the Graveyard, they are sent to the Graveyard like any other card.</p>
