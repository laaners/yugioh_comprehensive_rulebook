      If a monster equipped <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19748583">"Gwenhwyfar, Queen of Noble Arms"</span>, which has an effect that says "If the equipped monster battles an opponent's monster, at the start of the Damage Step: You can destroy that monster, then destroy this card.", battles with a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10817524">"First of the Dragons"</span> affected by its effect that says "This card cannot be destroyed by battle, except by battle with a Normal Monster, and is unaffected by other monsters' effects.", since the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19748583">"Gwenhwyfar, Queen of Noble Arms"</span> is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10817524">"First of the Dragons"</span> is destroyed.
