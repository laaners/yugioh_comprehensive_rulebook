    Monster Cards that are treated as Equip Cards are placed in the Spell & Trap Zone and are treated as Equip Spell Cards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    If a Monster Card that has become an Equip Card activates or applies an effect, that effect is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      If a monster equipped <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19748583">"Gwenhwyfar, Queen of Noble Arms"</span>, which has an effect that says "If the equipped monster battles an opponent's monster, at the start of the Damage Step: You can destroy that monster, then destroy this card.", battles with a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10817524">"First of the Dragons"</span> affected by its effect that says "This card cannot be destroyed by battle, except by battle with a Normal Monster, and is unaffected by other monsters' effects.", since the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19748583">"Gwenhwyfar, Queen of Noble Arms"</span> is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10817524">"First of the Dragons"</span> is destroyed.

<h3>Changing card type prevents Trigger effects from activating</h3>
<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has changed card type like from monster becomes an equip card, the Trigger Effect does not activate.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />When my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span> declares an attack, its effect is activated, and my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> in a chain by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span>. When resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span>, if I choose to equip the Special Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> to it, will that monster's effect be applied?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In this scenario, you can still choose to equip the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> that was Special Summoned by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> using the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span>. In that case, the Special Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> becomes an Equip Card, and is no longer a monster, so after the current chain resolves, its effect cannot be activated. (In this case, after the chain resolves, since the number of monsters on your opponent's side of the field changed, a replay will occur.)
