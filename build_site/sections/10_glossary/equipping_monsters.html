<p>
  Monster Cards that are treated as Equip Cards are placed in the Spell & Trap Zone and are treated as Equip Spell Cards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a Pendulum Monster has been placed in the left-most or right-most Spell & Trap Zone as an Equip Card, that Pendulum Monster is not treated as a card in a Pendulum Zone, its Pendulum Effects are not applied and a Pendulum Summon cannot be performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Monster Card that has become an Equip Card activates or applies an effect, that effect is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If a monster equipped <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19748583">"Gwenhwyfar, Queen of Noble Arms"</span> (1), which has an effect that says "If the equipped monster battles an opponent's monster, at the start of the Damage Step: You can destroy that monster, then destroy this card.", battles with a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10817524">"First of the Dragons"</span> (2) affected by its effect that says "This card cannot be destroyed by battle, except by battle with a Normal Monster, and is unaffected by other monsters' effects.", since the effect of (1) is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card, (2) is destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Equip Cards are treated as always targeting the equipped monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    <strong>EXCEPTION</strong>: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>

<h3>Monster Tokens</h3>
<p>
  Tokens placed in the Spell & Trap Zone have the ATK printed on the card that Special Summoned the Token.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span> can be equipped with a Token by its own effect. For example, if a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17418745">"Photon Token"</span> that was Special Summoned by the effect of Photon Sanctuary is equipped to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span>, the second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16255173">"The Grand Jupiter"</span> will increase its own ATK by the original ATK of the equipped <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17418745">"Photon Token"</span>, which is 2000.

<h3>Changing card type prevents Trigger effects from activating</h3>
<p>
  If, at the time of the particular timing, the card has changed card type like from monster becomes an equip card, the Trigger Effect does not activate.
  <br />
  Example: when my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27873305">"D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok"</span> (1) declares an attack, its effect is activated, and my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97077563">"Call of the Haunted"</span> in a chain by targeting <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33698022">"Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"</span> (2). When resolving the effect of (1), if I choose to equip the Special Summoned (2) to it, the Special Summoned (2) becomes an Equip Card, and is no longer a monster, so after the current chain resolves, its effect cannot be activated. (In this case, after the chain resolves, since the number of monsters on your opponent's side of the field changed, a replay will occur).
