          If you control a monster that is not a "Burning Abyss" monster, destroy this card. You can only use 1 of these effects of "Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss" per turn, and only once that turn.<br />
          ● If you control no Spells/Traps: You can Special Summon this card from your hand.<br />
          ● If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 monster on the field; banish it until the End Phase.

<ul>
  <li>If a monster banished by an effect for a time determined by those cards returns to the field, this is not treated as a Special Summon. As a result, Special Summon Monsters that have not been properly Special Summoned can also be returned.</li>
  <li>In most cases, cards that are banished temporarily do not start a chain when they are returned to the field.</li>
  <li>When cards that have been banished temporarily are returned to the field, they are returned in the battle position they were in before being banished. Similarly, if their controller had changed, they are returned to the side of the field of the controller they had before being banished. Also, if cards are banished face-down, they are returned face-down.</li>
  <li>If a monster that has been temporarily banished from the Extra Monster Zone is returned to the field, it is returned to a Main Monster Zone of its previous controller in the battle position they were in before being banished. At that time, there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is not returned to the field and it is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>When a monster that has been banished temporarily would be returned to the field, if there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is not returned to the field and it is sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>
    If a card that has been banished temporarily is Special Summoned or sent to the Graveyard by the effect of other cards, it is not returned to the field at the timing it would be returned to the field.
    <br />
    Example: After a monster banished by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36261276">"Interdimensional Matter Transporter"</span> that says "banish that target until the End Phase." is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9622164">"D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation"</span> that says "Special Summon it in face-up Attack Position, and equip it with this card", if it is banished once again, that monster is not returned to the field during the End Phase.
  </li>
  <li>If a card that is banished temporarily is returned to the field, in most cases it is not affected by the effects that were affecting it before it was banished.</li>
