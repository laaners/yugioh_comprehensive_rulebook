    If a monster banished by an effect for a time determined by those cards returns to the field, this is not treated as a Special Summon. As a result, Special Summon Monsters that have not been properly Special Summoned can also be returned<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In most cases, cards that are banished temporarily do not start a chain when they are returned to the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  </li>
  <li>
    When cards that have been banished temporarily are returned to the field, they are returned in the battle position they were in before being banished<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  </li>
  <li>
    When cards that have been banished temporarily are returned to the field, if their controller had changed, they are returned to the side of the field of the controller they had before being banished<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  <li>
    If cards are banished face-down, they are returned face-down<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  </li>
  <li>
    If a monster that has been temporarily banished from the Extra Monster Zone is returned to the field, it is returned to a Main Monster Zone of its previous controller in the battle position they were in before being banished. At that time, there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is not returned to the field and it is sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

    When a monster that has been banished temporarily would be returned to the field, if there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is not returned to the field and it is sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  </li>
  <li>
    If a card that has been banished temporarily is Special Summoned or sent to the Graveyard by the effect of other cards, it is not returned to the field at the timing it would be returned to the field<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      After a monster banished by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36261276">"Interdimensional Matter Transporter"</span> that says "banish that target until the End Phase." is Special Summoned by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9622164">"D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation"</span> that says "Special Summon it in face-up Attack Position, and equip it with this card", if it is banished once again, that monster is not returned to the field during the End Phase.

    If a card that is banished temporarily is returned to the field, in most cases it is not affected by the effects that were affecting it before it was banished<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

        If a card that is banished temporarily is returned to the field, it is treated as another card with the same name<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

          <u>Question:</u><br />I have resolved <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89883517">"Mistaken Accusation"</span> by targeting a face-up <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85087012">"Card Trooper"</span> in the Monster Zone.<br />Afterwards, that same <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85087012">"Card Trooper"</span> is then temporarily banished by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36553319">"Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span>. If it later returns to the field, can its effects be activated?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />After <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89883517">"Mistaken Accusation"</span> has begun applying, the effects of other cards with the same name as the target can no longer be activated. In this case, neither player can activate the effects of any "<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85087012">"Card Trooper"</span>"s except that targeted one.<br />If that targeted <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85087012">"Card Trooper"</span> is banished by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36553319">"Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span>, it is no longer treated as that targeted <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="85087012">"Card Trooper"</span>. Instead, it is now treated as another card with the same name. Therefore, even if it later returns to the field, neither of its effects can be activated.

    The controller of the monster that was temporarily banished chooses the zone it will be placed in, regardless of which player activated the effect to banish<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup

    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You have resolved <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span>'s "banish both [targeted monsters] until the End Phase" effect, banishing your opponent's monster. During the End Phase, that banished monster returns to my opponent's Monster Zone and your opponent may choose which zone their monster will return to.

  <li>
    Monsters not properly Special Summoned that are banished temporarily, will return to the field as returning is not considered as being Special Summoned<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
