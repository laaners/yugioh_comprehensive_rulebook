    Monsters which violate this kind of effects are sent to the graveyard and are not considered as destroyed by card effects.<br />
    Example: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62473983">"Gravekeeper's Chief"</span> is face-up on your side of the field, if a second <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62473983">"Gravekeeper's Chief"</span> you control is flipped face-up and thus destroyed, it is not treated as destroyed by a card effect.
