      <u>Question:</u><br />Due to the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74701381">"DNA Surgery"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="59969392">"Archfiend Zombie-Skull"</span> that are face-up on the field, all monsters on the field become Zombie type and Zombie monsters you control cannot be destroyed by card effects. If the second <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62473983">"Gravekeeper's Chief"</span> that has the effect that allows you to control only 1 face-up <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62473983">"Gravekeeper's Chief"</span> is flipped face-up by an attack, will it be destroyed?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When an effect that allows only 1 card of a specific name to be face-up on the field such as that of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62473983">"Gravekeeper's Chief"</span> is applied, if the second <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62473983">"Gravekeeper's Chief"</span> is flipped face-up and thus destroyed, it is not treated as destroyed by a card effect.<br />Therefore, even if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="59969392">"Archfiend Zombie-Skull"</span> is applied, the second <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62473983">"Gravekeeper's Chief"</span> that became a Zombie monster will be destroyed.
