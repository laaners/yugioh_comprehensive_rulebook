      <u>Question:</u><br />Due to the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74701381">"DNA Surgery"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="59969392">"Archfiend Zombie-Skull"</span> that are face-up on the field, all monsters on the field become Zombie type and Zombie monsters you control cannot be destroyed by card effects.
