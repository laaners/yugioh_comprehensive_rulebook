    When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card. Normally, revealed cards are returned to their original position after being looked at by both players<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
