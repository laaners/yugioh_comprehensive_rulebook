<h3>Continuous Spell/Trap Cards that destroy a card(s) on the field can target themselves</h3>
<p>
  Continuous Spell/Trap Cards that destroy a card(s) on the field can target themselves, if they are a valid target. Note that their effects can only legally be used in the same Chain Link of their card activation if there is a valid target on the field before activating the card in case it has a condition to be met (e.g. being a face-up card).
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />When activating the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18444733">"Thunder Dragon Discharge"</span> that destroys a Spell/Trap Card on the field, can I target that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18444733">"Thunder Dragon Discharge"</span> itself?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can target <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18444733">"Thunder Dragon Discharge"</span> with its own effect to destroy a Spell/Trap Card on the field.<br />(The effect will also banish 1 Thunder-Type monster from your Deck normally.)
