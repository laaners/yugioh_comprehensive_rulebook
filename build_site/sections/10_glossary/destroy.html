    A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered "destroyed." always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is activated, so that cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, cards that are destroyed are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards in the Graveyard or that are banished cannot be destroyed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      If the activation of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67441435">"Glow-Up Bulb"</span> that says "Special Summon this card banished by this effect" is negated by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40605147">"Solemn Strike"</span> that says "negate the Summon or activation, and if you do, destroy that card", the activation of the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67441435">"Glow-Up Bulb"</span> is negated, but it is not treated as being destroyed and it remains in the Graveyard.

<h3>Continuous Spell/Trap Cards that destroy a card(s) on the field can target themselves</h3>
<p>
  Continuous Spell/Trap Cards that destroy a card(s) on the field can target themselves, if they are a valid target. Note that their effects can only legally be used in the same Chain Link of their card activation if there is a valid target on the field before activating the card in case it has a condition to be met (e.g. being a face-up card).
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />When activating the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18444733">"Thunder Dragon Discharge"</span> that destroys a Spell/Trap Card on the field, can I target that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18444733">"Thunder Dragon Discharge"</span> itself?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can target <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18444733">"Thunder Dragon Discharge"</span> with its own effect to destroy a Spell/Trap Card on the field.<br />(The effect will also banish 1 Thunder-Type monster from your Deck normally.)

<h3>Destroy to Summon</h3>
<p>
  An effect that destroys a card(s) on your side of the field to summon can be activated even when all of your Main Monster Zones are full, but the card(s) you have to destroy must be one monster(s) in your Main Monster Zone.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <u>Question:</u><br />If there are 5 monsters in my Main Monster Zones, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56049970">"Crystron Prasiortle"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83443619">"Crystron Smiger"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29838323">"Crystron Thystvern"</span>, or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="55326322">"Crystron Rosenix"</span> that destroys a face-up card on my field and Special Summons a "Crystron" Tuner monster from my Deck?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />The effect of a monster such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="56049970">"Crystron Prasiortle"</span> Special Summons a "Crystron" Tuner monster from your Deck, so if there are already 5 monsters in your Main Monster Zones, you can only activate the effect by targeting a face-up monster in your Main Monster Zone. (Face-up cards in your Spell &amp; Trap Zones, Field Zone, or the Extra Monster Zone cannot be targeted.)
