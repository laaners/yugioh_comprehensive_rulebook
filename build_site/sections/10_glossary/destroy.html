<p>
  A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered "destroyed." always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is activated, so that cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, cards that are destroyed are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards in the Graveyard or that are banished cannot be destroyed<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.<br />
    Example: If the activation of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67441435">"Glow-Up Bulb"</span> that says "Special Summon this card banished by this effect" is negated by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40605147">"Solemn Strike"</span> that says "negate the Summon or activation, and if you do, destroy that card", the activation of the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67441435">"Glow-Up Bulb"</span> is negated, but it is not treated as being destroyed and it remains in the Graveyard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that say "destroy and sent to the Graveyard" or "destroy and banish", if they cannot destroy the card, the part of the effect that sends to the Graveyard or banishes is not performed either<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> ("and" conjuctive).
