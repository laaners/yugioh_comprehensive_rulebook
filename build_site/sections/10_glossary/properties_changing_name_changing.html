<p><strong>Interaction with other card effects</strong></p>
<ul class="glossary-entry-effect-interaction"></ul>

<h3>Name treated as vs name becomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Monsters that read "This card's name is always treated as [a particular card name]", have their name always treated as that name, even while in the Deck, hand, Graveyard, or otherwise outside of the field<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    If cards with an effect that say "This card's name is
    <strong>always</strong> treated as [...]" are included in the Deck, the card is treated as having that card name, for example: since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="80316585">"Cyber Harpie Lady"</span> says "(This card's name is always treated as "Harpie Lady".)", you can only include up to 3 copies in total of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76812113">"Harpie Lady"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="80316585">"Cyber Harpie Lady"</span> in your Main Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Up to 3 copies of cards that are treated as having a different name by an effect can be included separately from cards with the name that is provided by that effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Examples:

    <ul>
      <li>
        You can include 3 copies of each <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="89631139">"Blue-Eyes White Dragon"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38517737">"Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon"</span> which has an effect that says "This card's name <strong>becomes</strong> "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" while it is on the <strong>field or in the Graveyard</strong>."<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="24639891">"Gunkan Suship Shari"</span> is used to build a Deck, you can also use up to 3 <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63748694">"Gunkan Suship Shari"</span> which has an effect that says "This card's name becomes "Gunkan Suship Shari" while in the hand, <strong>Deck</strong>, GY, or on the field."<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Activating effect of a card whose name was changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    If a card whose name is treated as the name of a different card activates or applies its effects, that effect is treated as the effect of a card with the name it has at the moment.
    <br />
    Example: If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="47387961">"Number 8: Heraldic King Genom-Heritage"</span> treated as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84013237">"Number 39: Utopia"</span> activates its effect, that effect is activated as the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84013237">"Number 39: Utopia"</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an effect reads "You can only use this effect of [a particular card name] once per turn" or "You can only use the effect of a card with this name once per turn", this is not influenced by changes to the card's name on the field.<br />
    Example: If the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="92723496">"Giant Pairfish"</span> that says "You can discard 1 monster; Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower Wyrm-Type monster from your Deck. You can only use this effect of "Giant Pairfish" once per turn." is activated, and later its name changes by the effect of another card, the effect of the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="92723496">"Giant Pairfish"</span> that had its name changed during that turn cannot be activated.
  </li>
</ul>
