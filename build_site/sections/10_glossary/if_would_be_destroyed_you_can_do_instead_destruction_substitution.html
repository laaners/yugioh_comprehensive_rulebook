    For this kind of effects we identify the card (1) that applies the substitution effect for effect destruction, the card (2) that is being destroyed, and the card (3) that is substituting for (2)'s destruction (sometimes (1) and (3) are the same card). Regarding substitution effects when both (2) and (3) are being simultaneously destroyed:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Mandatory</b> substitution effects (1) applies even if the substituted card itself (3) would also be destroyed. In which case, only (1) will be destroyed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

          If both <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65685470">"Spirit of the Six Samurai"</span> (1)=(3) and the monster (2) it is equipped to would be destroyed at the same time by an effect such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18591904">"Final Destiny"</span>, effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65685470">"Spirit of the Six Samurai"</span> will be applied, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65685470">"Spirit of the Six Samurai"</span> will be destroyed instead, and the monster it was equipped to will remain on the field.

In this scenario, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17228908">"Lost World"</span> itself is destroyed by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53567095">"Icarus Attack"</span>, but <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81823360">"Megalosmasher X"</span> is not destroyed, and you destroy 1 Dinosaur-Type monster in your hand or Deck instead.

In this scenario, since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="55051920">"Orcustrated Core"</span> itself would be destroyed by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53567095">"Icarus Attack"</span>, you cannot apply its effect and send it to the Graveyard instead.
