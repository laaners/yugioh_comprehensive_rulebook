          If this card is Link Summoned: You can target 1 "Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles" in your GY; this card's name becomes that target's original name, and it gains that target's original effects, then equip that target to this card as an Equip Spell that gives it 500 ATK. Once per turn, when a Spell/Trap Card or effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can send 1 Equip Spell from your hand or face-up field to the GY; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card.

<ul>
  <li>
    Effects that "gain the effects of "X"" for Monsters are only applied as long as the card remains face-up in a Monster Zone. Since the card that gained the gained effects loses them once it leaves the field, effects that activate in the Graveyard or something similar cannot be activated or applied. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84565800">"Legendary Knight Hermos"</span> that has gained the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40737112">"Dark Magician of Chaos"</span> leaves the field, since it loses the gained effects, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40737112">"Dark Magician of Chaos"</span> that says "If this face-up card would leave the field, banish it instead" is not applied.</li>
      <li>If a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30312361">"Phantom of Chaos"</span> that has gained the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40028305">"Superheavy Samurai Soulclaw"</span> activates the effect that says "You can target 1 "Superheavy Samurai" monster you control; equip this monster from your hand or your side of the field to that target.", when the effect finishes resolving, its effect is no longer applied and it is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If the effects of another monster are gained by an effect that gains effects, the requirements to use that effect like "can only activate the effect of "X" once per turn" are also applied.
    <br />
    Example: you control two "Therion" monsters, each equipped with a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21727231">"Therion "Reaper" Fum"</span>. Due to the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21727231">"Therion "Reaper" Fum"</span>, both of these monsters have gained the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21727231">"Therion "Reaper" Fum"</span>, which allows to return cards on the field to the hand. During a single turn, you can only activate that effect of one of these monsters. You are considered to be using the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21727231">"Therion "Reaper" Fum"</span> to return a card to the hand not only if you activate that effect of a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21727231">"Therion "Reaper" Fum"</span>, but also if you activate that effect that another monster has gained. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21727231">"Therion "Reaper" Fum"</span>'s card text tells you that you can only use the effect to return to hand of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21727231">"Therion "Reaper" Fum"</span> once per turn. Therefore, you cannot use that effect twice during the same turn, even if different monsters have that effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the effects of another monster are gained by an effect that gains effects, the effect to gain effects itself is lost. Other effects that the monster originally had are not lost.
    <br />
    Example: Even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30312361">"Phantom of Chaos"</span> gains the effects of other monsters by its effect, the effect that says "Any Battle Damage your opponent takes from battles involving this card becomes 0" is still applied.
