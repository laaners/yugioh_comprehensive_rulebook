<p>Some cards have effects that activate when they or another card(s) "leave the field". For example, these effects activate when a monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck.</p>
<p>When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck.</p>
