<h3>Costs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When paying costs that say "discard to the Graveyard", if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, the activation of cards that discard to the Graveyard as a cost cannot be performed. Costs that simply say "discard" can be paid. In that case, the cards are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished as a result.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      While the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74968065">"Hecatrice"</span> that says "You can discard this card to the Graveyard to add 1 "Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen" from your Deck to your hand." cannot be activated, but the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62015408">"Ghost Reaper & Winter Cherries"</span> that says "During either player's turn, if your opponent controls more monsters than you do: You can discard this card;" can be activated.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>For costs that read "send to the Graveyard;", those monsters must be sent to the Graveyard in order to activate the effect. If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or similar is being applied, so that the cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished instead and so that it is not possible to send cards to the Graveyard, activations that send cards to the Graveyard as a cost cannot be performed.</li>
  <li>For costs that tribute, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, you can still Tribute monsters. In that case, the Tributed monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead.</li>

<h3>Banish only monsters and paying cost</h3>
<p>When the effect "any Monster sent to the GY is banished instead" is applying you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Cannot</strong> activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster to the Graveyard as a cost<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cannot</strong> activate a card or effect that send cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard as cost as there may be monster cards among them<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can</strong> activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster Card not treated as a Monster (for example treated as an Equip Spell Card) to the Graveyard as a cost<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>

<h3>Pendulum Monsters</h3>
<p>If an effect that says "Any monster sent to the Graveyard is banished instead." is being applied when a Pendulum Monster placed in the Pendulum Zone is destroyed, since it exists on the field as a Spell Card, it is not banished and it is added to the Extra Deck</p>

<p>If an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, so that (all kinds of) cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, the effect text takes precedence and Pendulum Monsters are not added to the Extra Deck and are banished instead.</p>
