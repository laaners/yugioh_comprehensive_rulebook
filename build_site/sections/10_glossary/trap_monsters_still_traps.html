  <li>
    If a Trap Card says it becomes a Monster Card after activation, 1 Main Monster Zone is chosen when it resolves and it is Special Summoned to that location<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The original ATK of Traps treated as monsters is the value determined by the effect that summoned them<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trap Monsters that say "This card is also still a Trap." do not occupy both a Monster Zone and a Spell & Trap Zone. They are only in the Monster Zone (where the card actually is) and do not take up a Spell & Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect is treated as a Trap Card (written on the card's text) and a Monster Card. As a result, it can be destroyed by cards that destroy monsters and cards that destroy Spells or Traps<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect has effects of its own, it is treated as an Effect Monster (written on the card's text)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Activated effects of Trap Cards treated as Monster Cards are still applied even if that Trap Card leaves the field, in most cases<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
