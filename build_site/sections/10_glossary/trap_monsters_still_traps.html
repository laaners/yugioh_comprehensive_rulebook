    If a Trap Card says it becomes a Monster Card after activation, 1 Main Monster Zone is chosen when it resolves and it is Special Summoned to that location<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    The original ATK of Traps treated as monsters is the value determined by the effect that summoned them<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trap Monsters that say "This card is also still a Trap." do not occupy both a Monster Zone and a Spell & Trap Zone. They are only in the Monster Zone (where the card actually is) and do not take up a Spell & Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect is treated as a Trap Card (written on the card's text) and a Monster Card. As a result, it can be destroyed by cards that destroy monsters and cards that destroy Spells or Traps<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect has effects of its own, it is treated as an Effect Monster (written on the card's text)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Activated effects of Trap Cards treated as Monster Cards are still applied even if that Trap Card leaves the field, in most cases<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.

  <li>
    Changing from only-Trap to Monster Trap, it does not create a new copy<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent has activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> by targeting a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> in my Spell &amp; Trap Zone. If I now activate that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> in response, what happens?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When this Chain resolves, you first resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span>'s first effect, Special Summoning it as a Normal Monster (which is still also treated as a Trap) to the Monster Zone, and potentially destroying a card on the field.<br />Then, after that, that Conquistador of the Golden Lord in the Monster Zone will be destroyed when the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> resolves. (Since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> is still treated as a Trap after being Special Summoned, it will still be targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> even after it is Special Summoned.)
