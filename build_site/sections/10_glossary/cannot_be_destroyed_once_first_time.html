      <u>Question:</u><br />If I have 2 copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79777187">"Bubble Barrier"</span> on my side of the field, will their effects prevent each "Performage" and "Performapal" monster on my side of the field from being destroyed twice per turn?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If you have 2 copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79777187">"Bubble Barrier"</span> on your side of the field, since each of their effects are applied at the same time when a "Performage" or "Performapal" monster would be destroyed, each one will still only not be destroyed once each turn. (The effect is the same as if you were only controlling 1 <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79777187">"Bubble Barrier"</span>.)

      <u>Question:</u><br /><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79777187">"Bubble Barrier"</span> is face-up on my side of the field, as well as a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26270847">"Performapal Silver Claw"</span> with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="981540">"Half Unbreak"</span> applied to it.<br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26270847">"Performapal Silver Claw"</span> battles a monster with higher ATK in this situation, will the first effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="79777187">"Bubble Barrier"</span> be applied?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In this situation, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="26270847">"Performapal Silver Claw"</span> is already cannot be destroyed by battle due to the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="981540">"Half Unbreak"</span>.
