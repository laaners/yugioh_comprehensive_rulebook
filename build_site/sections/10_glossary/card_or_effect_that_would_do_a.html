    You possess a fast effect (1) that can be chained when "a card or effect is activated that would do [A]". At card or effect activation of (2), it must be determined if [A] happens or not in order to chain (1) to (2)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36468556">"Ceasefire"</span>, will the effect of a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64184058">"Destiny HERO - Decider"</span> in my Graveyard that adds it to my hand and reduces the effect damage to 0 activate?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If your opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36468556">"Ceasefire"</span>, you must determine whether or not it would inflict damage to you. For example, if the only monsters on the field are in face-down Defense Position, and/or are face-up Normal Monsters, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36468556">"Ceasefire"</span> is not an effect that you know will inflict damage to you, so the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64184058">"Destiny HERO - Decider"</span> in your Graveyard does not activate. Note that if any face-up Effect Monsters are present on the field, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64184058">"Destiny HERO - Decider"</span> will activate.

    You possess a fast effect (1) that can be chained when "a card or effect is activated that would do [A]". If [A] is determined to happen at resolution of a card or effect activation (2), (1) cannot be chained to (2)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

        <u>Question:</u><br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50470982">"The Paths of Destiny"</span> is activated, will the effect of a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64184058">"Destiny HERO - Decider"</span> in my Graveyard that adds it to my hand and reduces the effect damage to 0 activate?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Whether or not the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="50470982">"The Paths of Destiny"</span> will inflict damage to you is determined when resolving it. Therefore, since it is not a card effect that you know will inflict damage to you, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="64184058">"Destiny HERO - Decider"</span> in your Graveyard does not activate<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

        <u>Question:</u><br />If I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30915572">"Gallis the Star Beast"</span>, can I chain the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4081665">"Performage Stilts Launcher"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30915572">"Gallis the Star Beast"</span> resolves, if the card sent from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard is a monster, you inflict damage to your opponent based on that monster's Level. Because the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30915572">"Gallis the Star Beast"</span> is not guaranteed to inflict damage to your opponent, you cannot chain the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4081665">"Performage Stilts Launcher"</span> to it<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
