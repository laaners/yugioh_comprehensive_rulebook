    As long as a monster was involved in an inappropriate attack at any point (even if the attack never reached the Damage Step), it can no longer attack all monsters once each<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. For example, you control <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span> that can attack all monsters your opponent's monsters once each:
    <ul>
      <li>Your opponent only controls a single monster, and you declare an attack on that monster using <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span>. That monster leaves the field due to a card effect, and a replay occurs. Your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span> can then attack directly.</li>
      <li>Your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span> attacks your opponent directly, and damage calculation is performed. Afterwards, a card effect Special Summons a monster to your opponent's field. Since damage calculation has been performed for the direct attack, you cannot attack the other monster.</li>
      <li>Your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span> attacks your opponent's only monster, and that monster is destroyed by the battle. You cannot attack directly afterwards.</li>
      <li>Your opponent controls two monsters, and your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span>, equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95638658">"Shooting Star Bow - Ceal"</span>, attacks directly. During the Battle Step, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95638658">"Shooting Star Bow - Ceal"</span> is destroyed by a card effect, causing a replay, in the course of which <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span> attacks and destroy one of your opponent's monsters. Since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23288411">"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation"</span> has declared a direct attack, it cannot attack all your opponent's monsters, once each due to its effect, even if the direct attack's target changes to a monster during a replay.</li>
