<h3>Activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target</h3>
<p>
  Equip Spell Cards always target, but activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target.
  <br />
  Example: The Quick Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> was activated by targeting an equipped Trap you control. When that effect resolves, you can equip that Trap to your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4167084">"The First Darklord"</span>, even though it cannot be targeted by card effects. That effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> does not require you to target any monsters.

<h3>Equip Cards and Activation Legality</h3>
<p>
  Equip Cards with impossible Continuous Effects can be activated.
  <br />
  Example: a Link Monster can be equipped with <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="38552107">"Horn of Light"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span>. However, since Link Monsters do not have DEF, the effect of increasing DEF is not applied. In the case of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="95515060">"Rod of Silence - Kay'est"</span> , the effect that negates other Spells' effects targeting the equipped monster and destroys them is applied normally.
