<ul>
  <li>Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards</li>

<h3>Equipping Monsters</h3>

<p>
  Monster Cards that are treated as Equip Cards are placed in the Spell & Trap Zone and are treated as Equip Spell Cards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a Pendulum Monster has been placed in the left-most or right-most Spell & Trap Zone as an Equip Card, that Pendulum Monster is not treated as a card in a Pendulum Zone, its Pendulum Effects are not applied and a Pendulum Summon cannot be performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Monster Card that has become an Equip Card activates or applies an effect, that effect is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: If a monster equipped <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="19748583">"Gwenhwyfar, Queen of Noble Arms"</span> (1), which has an effect that says "If the equipped monster battles an opponent’s monster, at the start of the Damage Step: You can destroy that monster, then destroy this card.", battles with a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10817524">"First of the Dragons"</span> (2) affected by its effect that says "This card cannot be destroyed by battle, except by battle with a Normal Monster, and is unaffected by other monsters’ effects.", since the effect of (1) is treated as the effect of an Equip Spell Card, (2) is destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a monster that has been equipped with Equip Cards by its effect has its effects negated, they are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="33460840">"Guardian of Felgrand"</span> (1) has been equipped with a card by its effect that says "If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can equip 1 Level 7 or 8 Dragon-Type monster from your hand or Graveyard to this card.", if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> is applied, the effects of (1) are negated and the monster that was equipped is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Equip Cards are treated as always targeting the equipped monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the effects of an Equip Card equipped to a monster are negated, the effects are negated but it remains on the field equipped to the equipped monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: While the Union monster <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67159705">"Armored Cybern"</span> (1) is equipped to a monster, if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37267041">"Silent Swordsman LV7"</span> that says "Negate all Spell effects on the field." is applied, the effects of (1) are negated but it stays equipped to the equipped monster.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    <strong>EXCEPTION</strong>: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Equipping Traps</h3>
<p>Cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13317419">"Rocket Hand"</span> that equip themselves to a monster after activation are Normal Trap Cards that remain on the field after activation. After they become Equip Cards, they are also treated as Trap Cards. <strong>They have every other rule that Equip Spell Cards have</strong>.</p>
