    The term "Equip Card" includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards.</li>
      <li>Equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Equip Cards are treated as always targeting the equipped monster<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Equip Spell Cards always target, but activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />The Quick Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> was activated by targeting an equipped Trap you control.<br />When that effect resolves, can I equip that Trap to my opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4167084">"The First Darklord"</span>, even though it cannot be targeted by card effects?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, you can.<br />That effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30829071">"Amazement Ambassador Bufo"</span> does not require you to target any monsters. Thus, you can equip your Trap to a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4167084">"The First Darklord"</span> that cannot be targeted by your card effects.
