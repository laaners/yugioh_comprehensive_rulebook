    Taking example as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span>, effects that say "card that specifically lists/mentions the card "Dark Magician"" in the effects of cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7084129">"Magician's Rod"</span> means that the card name <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span>" is listed in the effect text, excluding cards that only say <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span> in places outside the effect text section, like in their card name or illustration<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the case of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="1784686">"The Eye of Timaeus"</span> that does not specifically list a particular card name by saying "a "Dark Magician" Monster", it is not treated as a "card that specifically lists/mentions the card "Dark Magician"", even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span> is placed in its effect text<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<h3>Ritual Monsters whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card</h3>
<p>
  The text "A Ritual Monster whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card" means a Ritual Monster whose card name is written in the effect text of the corresponding Ritual Spell Card, like how <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5405694">"Black Luster Soldier"</span> is written in the effect text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="55761792">"Black Luster Ritual"</span><sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In cases in which a particular card name is not designated, like how ""Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monster" is written in the text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14094090">"Super Soldier Ritual"</span>, this is not treated as "a Ritual Monster whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card"<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the card names of 2 or more Ritual Monsters are written in the Ritual Spell Card chosen by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13048472">"Pre-Preparation of Rites"</span>, 1 of them is added to the hand. If at the time of the resolution of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13048472">"Pre-Preparation of Rites"</span> it is not possible to add the chosen Ritual Spell Card and the corresponding Ritual Monster to the hand, neither can be added to the hand ("and" conjunctive)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />Can I add <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23459650">"Rebirth of Nephthys"</span> to my hand by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13048472">"Pre-Preparation of Rites"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You can add <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23459650">"Rebirth of Nephthys"</span> to your hand with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13048472">"Pre-Preparation of Rites"</span>. Note that the Ritual Monster you add to your hand must have its name written in the text, meaning you must add either <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88176533">"Devotee of Nephthys"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="24175232">"Cerulean Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"</span> to your hand. (Therefore, you can activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13048472">"Pre-Preparation of Rites"</span> as long as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="23459650">"Rebirth of Nephthys"</span> exists in your Deck, and either <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="88176533">"Devotee of Nephthys"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="24175232">"Cerulean Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"</span> exist in your Deck/Graveyard.)
