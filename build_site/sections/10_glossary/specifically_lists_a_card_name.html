<ul>
  <li>Taking example as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span>, effects that say "card that specifically lists/mentions the card "Dark Magician"" in the effects of cards like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7084129">"Magician's Rod"</span> means that the card name <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span>" is listed in the effect text, excluding cards that only say <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span> in places outside the effect text section, like in their card name or illustration.</li>
  <li>For the case of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="1784686">"The Eye of Timaeus"</span> that does not specifically list a particular card name by saying "a "Dark Magician" Monster", it is not treated as a "card that specifically lists/mentions the card "Dark Magician"", even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36996508">"Dark Magician"</span> is placed in its effect text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ritual Monsters whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card</h3>
<p>The text "A Ritual Monster whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card" means a Ritual Monster whose card name is written in the effect text of the corresponding Ritual Spell Card, like how <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5405694">"Black Luster Soldier"</span> is written in the effect text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="55761792">"Black Luster Ritual"</span>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In cases in which a particular card name is not designated, like how ""Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monster" is written in the text of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14094090">"Super Soldier Ritual"</span>, this is not treated as "a Ritual Monster whose name is listed on a Ritual Spell Card".</li>
  <li>
    If the card names of 2 or more Ritual Monsters are written in the Ritual Spell Card chosen by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13048472">"Pre-Preparation of Rites"</span>, 1 of them is added to the hand.<br />
    If at the time of the resolution of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="13048472">"Pre-Preparation of Rites"</span> it is not possible to add the chosen Ritual Spell Card and the corresponding Ritual Monster to the hand, neither can be added to the hand (the card has a "and" conjunctive).

<h3>Substitute for any 1 Fusion Material and Fusion Summoning a Fusion Monster that lists "X" as material</h3>
<p>
  If a card "Fusion Summons a Fusion Monster that lists "X" as material", it must use a material requirement that meets "X", and must also use a monster that meets "X" to meet that specific requirement.
  <br />
  Example: you control a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53493204">"Goddess with the Third Eye"</span> (LIGHT) and a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="68468459">"Fallen of Albaz"</span> (DARK). When you resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44362883">"Branded Fusion"</span>, you can't Fusion Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70534340">"Lubellion the Searing Dragon"</span>, which lists "1 DARK monster + "Fallen of Albaz"" as the necessary materials. The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53493204">"Goddess with the Third Eye"</span> allows it to substitute for a Fusion Material, but does not change its name.
