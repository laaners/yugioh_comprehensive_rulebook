    This is not a card effect that affects monsters but it's an effect applied to your opponent<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>Question:</u><br />When my opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span> resolves, there are multiple cards on my field, including a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45148985">"Metaphys Executor"</span>. What happens?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You still follow <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span>'s text. (You can also choose <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45148985">"Metaphys Executor"</span> as the monster to be banished.)<br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span> is an effect that is applied to the activating player's opponent. When this effect is applied, that opponent will banish cards on their field, face-down. In such a case, these cards are not treated as being banished by a card effect.<br />Therefore, when activating or resolving <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span>, the first effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45148985">"Metaphys Executor"</span>, which makes it unable to be banished by card effects, is irrelevant.<br />This also applies to the following cards' effects that prevent banishing by card effect, in place of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45148985">"Metaphys Executor"</span>: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45001322">"Libromancer Firestarter"</span>, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="41085464">"Libromancer Bonded"</span><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Question:</u><br />I control the Machine-Type <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87182127">"Ancient Gear Howitzer"</span>, and the Warrior-Type <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63504681">"Number 86: Heroic Champion - Rhongomyniad"</span>. Both are applying their respective "unaffected by other cards' effects" effects.<br />My opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span> now resolves while it is the only card on their field. Do I need to banish one of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87182127">"Ancient Gear Howitzer"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63504681">"Number 86: Heroic Champion - Rhongomyniad"</span> face-down?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />You must choose one of them, and banish it face-down.<br />When <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span> resolves, its effect is applied to your opponent. As a result, your opponent must choose cards on their field, and banish them face-down. These cards, which are banished during the resolution of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15693423">"Evenly Matched"</span>, are not treated as being banished by a card effect.<br />Therefore, even monsters that are unaffected by Trap effects will be banished face-down. Additionally, these monsters are not treated as having left the field due to a Trap effect<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Cards sent to the Graveyard by this procedure are not considered to be sent to the Graveyard by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />The opponent sent a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37445295">"Shaddoll Falco"</span> to the Graveyard as a result of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27279764">"Apoqliphort Towers"</span> that makes the opponent send a monster to the Graveyard.<br />In this case, can the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37445295">"Shaddoll Falco"</span> that Special Summons itself be activated?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27279764">"Apoqliphort Towers"</span> is applied, it makes the opponent send a monster they control or in their hand to the Graveyard.<br />At that time, even if the opponent sent <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37445295">"Shaddoll Falco"</span> to the Graveyard, that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37445295">"Shaddoll Falco"</span> is not considered to be sent to the Graveyard by a card effect.<br />Therefore, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37445295">"Shaddoll Falco"</span> that Special Summons itself cannot be activated.
