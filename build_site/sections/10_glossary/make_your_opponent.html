    Cards sent to the graveyard by this kind of effect are not considered to be sent to the Graveyard by a card effect.
    <br />
    Example: The opponent sent a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37445295">"Shaddoll Falco"</span> (1) to the Graveyard as a result of the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27279764">"Apoqliphort Towers"</span> that "makes the opponent send a monster to the Graveyard". At that time, even if the opponent sent (1) to the Graveyard, that (1) is not considered to be sent to the Graveyard by a card effect. Therefore, the effect of (1) that Special Summons itself cannot be activated.
