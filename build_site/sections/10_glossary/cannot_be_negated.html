    If a monster (1) activates its effect while an effect that prevents its activation to be negated is applying (2), a card that negates the activation of effects can still be activated in chain. In that case, since (2) prevents the activation of (1)'s effects from being negated, the activation is not negated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If a LIGHT monster activates its effect while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="86825483">"Constellar Belt"</span> is active, can <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49010598">"Divine Wrath"</span> be activated in a chain?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49010598">"Divine Wrath"</span> can still be activated. In that case, since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="86825483">"Constellar Belt"</span> prevents the activation of LIGHT monsters' effects from being negated, the activation is not negated, and the monster is not destroyed either.
