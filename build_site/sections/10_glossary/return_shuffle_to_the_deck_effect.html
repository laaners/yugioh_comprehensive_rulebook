    If cards are returned to the Deck, that card is added face-down to the Deck and is shuffled. However, if a card is returned to a specified location like the top or bottom of the Deck, the shuffling is not performed<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If, at the timing a card effect can be activated, that card has been returned to the Deck, in most cases that effect cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    An activating Quick-Play Spell Card (1) cannot be returned to the Deck by an effect (2) in chain that does so. This is the case either when (1) is a Chain Link lower than (2) or vice versa: (1) is not a legal target for (2)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent has 1 Set card in their Spell &amp; Trap Zone.<br />In this situation, I Ritual Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25415052">"Shinobaroness Peacock"</span>. I then activate its effect that returns up to 3 of my opponent's Spell/Trap Cards to the Deck, then Special Summons a Level 4 or lower Spirit monster from my Deck.<br />My opponent activates their Set card in response, which is a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>. How does the effect of
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25415052">"Shinobaroness Peacock"</span>
      resolve?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25415052">"Shinobaroness Peacock"</span>, a
      <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="5318639">"Mystical Space Typhoon"</span>
      that was activated in response cannot be returned to the Deck.<br />In this scenario, if there are no other Spell/Trap Cards on my opponent's field, you cannot apply the part of the effect that returns your opponent's Spell/Trap Cards to the Deck. As a result, you also cannot Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Spirit monster from your Deck.
