      <u>Question:</u><br />While there is a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000090">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Immortal Phoenix"</span> in my Graveyard, both <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000010">"The Winged Dragon of Ra"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81035362">"Fiendish Rhino Warrior"</span> are simultaneously sent to the Graveyard due to the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="53129443">"Dark Hole"</span>.<br />In this situation, how are the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000090">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Immortal Phoenix"</span> that summons it from the Graveyard and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81035362">"Fiendish Rhino Warrior"</span> that sends a Fiend monster to the Graveyard processed?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000090">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Immortal Phoenix"</span> is in the Graveyard, its effect that summons it from the Graveyard must always be activated if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000010">"The Winged Dragon of Ra"</span> is sent from the field to the Graveyard. Furthermore, neither player can activate cards or effects in response to that effect's activation.<br />Therefore, in the given situation, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="10000090">"The Winged Dragon of Ra - Immortal Phoenix"</span> must be activated as Chain Link 1, and will then resolve.<br />(As it is not possible to activate cards or effects in response to this activation, the effect of the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="81035362">"Fiendish Rhino Warrior"</span> that was sent to the Graveyard cannot be activated.)<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>

    If an effect of this kind is applying that makes so only the opponent cannot respond to a specific event (1), but you chain another card (2) when (1) happens, the opponent is now able to respond to (1)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />I control <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="47679935">"Magical Meltdown"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18973184">"Branded Lost"</span>, and the respective "your opponent cannot activate cards or effects when a monster is Fusion Summoned" effect is applying.<br />During my turn, my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40975243">"Tri-Brigade Revolt"</span> as Chain Link 1, and I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21011044">"Shaddoll Schism"</span> as Chain Link 2 in response. When this Chain resolves, I first Fusion Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>, and then my opponent Link Summons <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99726621">"Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"</span>.<br />In this situation, can my opponent then activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99726621">"Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"</span> after I activate the effect of my <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />Yes, they can.<br />The activation of Chain Link 1 resolves strictly after you have Fusion Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>. Therefore, after the Chain finishes resolving, it is not "when a monster is Fusion Summoned this way".
