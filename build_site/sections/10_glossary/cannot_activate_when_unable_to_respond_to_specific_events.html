    These are cards that make so a player is unable to respond to when specific events happen<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an effect of this kind is applying that makes so only the opponent cannot respond to a specific event (1), but you chain another card (2) when that event happens, the opponent is now able to respond<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: after the effect of your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="93506862">"Gishki Vanity"</span> has resolved, if you activate a "Gishki" Ritual Spell, and then chain another card or effect to that activation, your opponent can then respond to that second activation.
