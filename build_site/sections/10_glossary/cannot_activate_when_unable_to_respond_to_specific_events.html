    If an effect of this kind is applying that makes so only the opponent cannot respond to a specific event (1), but you chain another card (2) when (1) happens, the opponent is now able to respond to (1)<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup

    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You control <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="47679935">"Magical Meltdown"</span> or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18973184">"Branded Lost"</span>, and the respective "your opponent cannot activate cards or effects when a monster is Fusion Summoned" effect is applying. During your turn, your opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40975243">"Tri-Brigade Revolt"</span> as Chain Link 1, and you activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21011044">"Shaddoll Schism"</span> as Chain Link 2 in response. When this Chain resolves, you first Fusion Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>, and then your opponent Link Summons <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99726621">"Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"</span>. In this situation, your opponent can then activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99726621">"Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"</span> after you activate the effect of your <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>. The activation of Chain Link 1 resolves strictly after you have Fusion Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20366274">"El Shaddoll Construct"</span>. Therefore, after the Chain finishes resolving, it is not "when a monster is Fusion Summoned this way".
