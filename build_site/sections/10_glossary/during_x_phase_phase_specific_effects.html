      <u>Question:</u><br />If two copies of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2542230">"Red Cocoon"</span> were sent to the Graveyard during the same turn, can both of their effects that Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70902743">"Red Dragon Archfiend"</span> from your Graveyard be activated during the End Phase?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />If two <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="2542230">"Red Cocoon"</span> were sent to the Graveyard during the same turn, you can activate both of their effects during the End Phase. In that case, you can activate both effects in a single chain or activate them separately in different chains.

      <u>Question:</u><br />If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase, can I activate its effect that adds a Level 3 DARK Fiend-Type monster from my Deck to my hand immediately?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> does not start a chain at the time it is sent to the Graveyard.<br />Therefore, even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is sent to the Graveyard during the End Phase, you cannot activate its effect immediately at that time.<br />Similarly, if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span> is discarded for your hand size limit, you cannot activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84764038">"Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"</span>.
