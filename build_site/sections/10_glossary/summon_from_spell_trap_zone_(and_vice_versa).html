        Changing from only-Spell/Trap to only-Monster creates a new copy: an effect (1) targets a Monster Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone ((1) is <b>not</b> treated as a Monster). If another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone, then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

          <u>Question:</u><br />While a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15005145">"Centur-Ion Primera"</span> is treated as a Continuous Trap in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84815190">"Baronne de Fleur"</span>'s "target 1 card on the field; destroy it" effect has been activated by targeting it. In response, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15005145">"Centur-Ion Primera"</span>'s third effect, which Special Summons it from the Spell &amp; Trap Zone, resolves.<br />As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15005145">"Centur-Ion Primera"</span> has been Special Summoned to the Monster Zone by the time <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84815190">"Baronne de Fleur"</span>'s effect resolves. What happens to that effect?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When the effect resolves, nothing happens.<br />Due to its third effect, the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15005145">"Centur-Ion Primera"</span> has changed from being a Continuous Trap to being a Monster. (It is no longer a Continuous Trap.) As a result, it is no longer targeted by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84815190">"Baronne de Fleur"</span>.

          <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent has activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> by targeting a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in my Spell &amp; Trap Zone. If I now activate that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in response, what happens when this Chain resolves?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the situation you describe, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> will first be Special Summoned when resolving its Trap Card activation and applying its first effect. At this time, since it is no longer treated as a Trap Card, it also stops being targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>. Therefore, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>'s effect is then not applied.<br />This also applies to the following Trap Cards, which also have effects that Special Summon them as a monster (without being treated as a Trap Card): <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="74577599">"Traptrix Holeutea"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="62645025">"The Phantom Knights of Wrong Magnetring"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36247316">"The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20447641">"Qlife's End"</span>, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="51606429">"The Phantom Knights of Tomb Shield"</span>.

          <u>Question:</u><br />My opponent has activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> by targeting a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> in my Spell &amp; Trap Zone. If I now activate that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> in response, what happens?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />When this Chain resolves, you first resolve <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span>'s first effect, Special Summoning it as a Normal Monster (which is still also treated as a Trap) to the Monster Zone, and potentially destroying a card on the field.<br />Then, after that, that Conquistador of the Golden Lord in the Monster Zone will be destroyed when the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> resolves. (Since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> is still treated as a Trap after being Special Summoned, it will still be targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> even after it is Special Summoned.)
