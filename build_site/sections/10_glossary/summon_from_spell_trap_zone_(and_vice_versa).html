    An effect (1) targets a Monster Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone ((1) is <b>not</b> treated as a Monster). If another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone, then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: while a Centur-Ion Primera is treated as a Continuous Trap in the Spell & Trap Zone, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84815190">"Baronne de Fleur"</span>'s "target 1 card on the field; destroy it" effect has been activated by targeting it. In response, Centur-Ion Primera's effect is activated, which Special Summons it from the Spell & Trap Zone and it resolves. By the time <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84815190">"Baronne de Fleur"</span>'s effect resolves, the Centur-Ion Primera has changed from being a Continuous Trap to being a Monster. (It is no longer a Continuous Trap.) As a result, it is no longer targeted by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="84815190">"Baronne de Fleur"</span> and nothing happens.
  </li>
  <li>
    Similary, if (1) targets (2) while in a Monster Zone but (2) is placed in the Spell/Trap Zone, (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#summon_from_spell_trap_zone-2">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    An effect (1) targets a Spell/Trap Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone. If another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone (and (2) is <b>not</b> treated as a Spell/Trap at resolution), then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: my opponent has activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> by targeting a Set The <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in my Spell & Trap Zone. If I now activate that<span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> in response, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span> will first be Special Summoned when resolving its Trap Card. At this time, since it is no longer treated as a Trap Card, it also stops being targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>. Therefore, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>'s effect is then not applied.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changing from only-Trap to Monster Trap, it does not create a new copy<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: your opponent has activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> by targeting a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> in your Spell & Trap Zone. If you now activate that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> in response, you first Special Summon it as a Normal Monster (which is still also treated as a Trap) to the Monster Zone, and potentially destroying a card on the field. Then, after that, that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="20590515">"Conquistador of the Golden Land"</span> in the Monster Zone will be destroyed when the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> resolves.
