<p>Regarding Trap Monsters still treated as Traps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If a Trap Card says it becomes a Monster Card after activation, 1 Main Monster Zone is chosen when it resolves and it is Special Summoned to that location<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trap Monsters that say "This card is also still a Trap." do not occupy both a Monster Zone and a Spell & Trap Zone. They are only in the Monster Zone (where the card actually is) and do not take up a Spell & Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    A Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect is treated as a Trap Card (written on the card's text) and a Monster Card. As a result, it can be destroyed by cards that destroy monsters and cards that destroy Spells or Traps<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect has effects of its own, it is treated as an Effect Monster (written on the card's text)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>Activated effects of Trap Cards treated as Monster Cards are still applied even if that Trap Card leaves the field, in most cases.</li>
  <li>
    If a Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect is flipped face-down by an effect, it is placed face-down in the Spell & Trap Zone<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. It can be activated in the next turn and become a Monster Card once again.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the effects of a Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by its own effect are negated, it is placed face-up in the Spell & Trap Zone. Afterwards, even if its effects effects are active again, it is not treated as a Monster Card<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding Trap Monsters NOT treated as Traps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Trap Cards treated as Monster Cards which say they are not treated as a Trap Card, like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98827725">"The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"</span>, are only treated as Monster Cards. As a result, they cannot be destroyed by effects that destroy Spell or Trap Cards<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if a Trap Card treated as a Monster Card which says it is not treated as a Trap Card is flipped face-down by the effect of "Book of Moon" or something similar, it is flipped face-down in the Main Monster Zone. If it is flipped face-up again, it is treated as a Monster according to what its text indicates<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even when a Trap Card treated as a Monster Card which says it is not treated as a Trap Card has its effects negated, it remains in the Main Monster Zone<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changing from only-Monster to only-Spell/Trap creates a new copy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    If an effect (1) targets a Monster Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone ((1) is not treated as a Monster), if another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone, then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

  </li>
  <li>
    Similary, if (1) targets (2) while in a Monster Zone but (2) is placed in the Spell/Trap Zone, (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#summon_from_spell_trap_zone-2">[2]</a></sup

  <li>
    If an effect (1) targets a Spell/Trap Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone, if another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone (and (2) is not treated as a Spell/Trap), then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully
