<p>Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or activating an effect. A monster sent to the Graveyard by Tributing is not treated as "destroyed."</p>

<h3>Tributes for a Tribute Summon</h3>

<p>Sending monsters on the field to the Graveyard for a Tribute Summon is called Tributing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Face-down monsters on the field can also be Tributed.</li>
  <li>The Tributes are performed at the time the Tribute Summon is declared, before the monster that would be Normal Summoned/Set is placed on the field. Even if the Tribute Summon is negated, the Tributed monsters are sent to the Graveyard normally.</li>
  <li>You can only Tribute monsters you control.</li>
  <li>Monster Tokens on the field can also be Tributed. In this case, the tokens are not sent to the Graveyard and they are removed from the Duel.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be Tributed. In that case, that Tributed Trap Card is sent to the Graveyard, providing no particular effect is being applied.</li>
  <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29549364">"Mask of Restrict"</span> has been activated, so that monsters cannot be Tributed, a Tribute Summon cannot be performed.</li>
  <li>Monsters that you control in the Extra Monster Zones can also be used as tributes for a Tribute Summon.</li>
  <li>Even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, monsters can still be Tributed. In that case, the Tributed monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tributes of a Ritual</h3>
<p>Tributes for a ritual are sent to the Graveyard as a result of the effect of the Ritual Spell Card.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the activation of the Ritual Spell Card is negated, since the resolution is not performed, the Tributing is not performed either.</li>
  <li>Unless stated otherwise, you can only Tribute monsters in your posssession.</li>
  <li>If the Ritual Spell says "whose total Levels equal X", you must Tribute monsters so that the sum of the Level matches that value exactly. Also, if "whose total Levels equal X or more" is written, the sum does not need to be exactly equal as long as it is equal or more.</li>
  <li>
    The number of Tributed monsters cannot be higher than necessary.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30392583">"Prediction Ritual"</span> is activated and its effect that says "You must also Tribute monsters from your hand or field whose total Levels equal 9 or more" resolves, you cannot Tribute a Level 9 and a Level 2 monster, as the Levels already add up to 9 or more with only 1 monster. You can Tribute a Level 5 and a Level 6 monster.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>Monster Tokens on the field can also be Tributed. In that case, Tokens that would be sent to the Graveyard are removed from the Duel.</li>
  <li>Since Xyz Monsters and Link Monsters do not have a Level, they cannot be used for the tributes of a Ritual Summon.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be tributed. In that case, the Tributed Trap Cards are sent to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>The Tributes for the Ritual Summon are Tributed by an effect, but afterwards the Ritual Summon is performed. For that reason, optional Trigger Effects that read "when it is sent to the Graveyard, you can [...]" that can be activated in that timing cannot be activated during that procedure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tributing cost</h3>

<p>Reminder of costs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Costs must be performed at the time the card is activated, and even if the activation or effect of the card is negated, they are not refunded<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the player cannot suffice the costs, they cannot activate the card<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Costs are not treated as card effects<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless stated otherwise, costs can only be paid with cards in your possession<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In order to activate effects that read "Tribute X;", those monsters need to be Tributed. The Tributed monsters are sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Tributed monsters are not treated as being destroyed. As a result, they are treated as being sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if the monsters that would be Tributed need to meet certain requirements, face-down monsters on the field can be sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      A face-down <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="75195825">"Master Pendulum, the Dracoslayer"</span> can be Tributed as a cost to activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="16960351">"Dracocension"</span>, which reads "You can Tribute 1 Dragon-Type monster that has a Level; Special Summon, from your Deck, 1 Wyrm-Type monster with the same Level as the Tributed monster's original Level, and if you do, any monster destroyed by battle with that monster is shuffled into the Deck instead of going to the Graveyard.".
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, you can still Tribute monsters. In that case, the Tributed monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
