<ul>
  <li>
    Cards that switch control are treated as cards of their current controller. They can also be used to pay costs or for Special Summons like Fusion Summons, Synchro Summons, Xyz Summons or Link Summons<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card on the field that has changed control later leaves the field, it is moved to the owner's location<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have no available Main Monster Zones, you cannot activate an effect that would take control of an opponent's monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Vice versa, you cannot activate an effect that gives control of a monster if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have 5 monsters in your Main Monster Zones before the resolution of an effect that switches control of a monster, the monster that would switch control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. In that case, it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      After you take control of an opponent's monster with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98045062">"Enemy Controller"</span> that says "take control of that target until the End Phase", if the opponent has no available Main Monster Zones, the monster whose control would return is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
      <hr />
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you take control of your opponent's monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If control of a monster that was stolen from the Extra Monster Zone is returned, it is not returned to the Extra Monster Zone of the owner, and is instead placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the previous controller. If there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    "the effect(s) of this card can only be activated once per turn" or simply "once per turn:" is written on card (different from "the effect of [card name] can only be activated/used once per turn"). If that card control switches to the opponent, its effects cannot be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You have activated the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29981921">"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En"</span> that negates the activation of a Spell/Trap Card. If control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29981921">"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En"</span> is now changed due to <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98045062">"Enemy Controller"</span>'s effect, your opponent cannot use the same effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29981921">"Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En"</span> this turn, even if they take control of it.

    "the effect of [card name] can only be used once per turn" is written on card. If that card control switches to the opponent, its effects can be activated<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup

<h3>Changing control and Trigger effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Monsters changing control after their Trigger effect meets its activation condition can activate their effects after they've changed control (in which case the player who took control of the monster activates it)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span> in your Graveyard, banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> as a cost from your Graveyard and targeting your opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span>. When resolving this effect, you gain control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> and you can activate the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> you gained control of due the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span>.

    You activate a card (1) that takes control of an opponent monster as Chain Link 1. (1) does not target. Your opponent activates as Chain Link 2 an effect that summons a monster (2). The chain resolves backwards, (2) is special summoned first, then with (1) you take control of an opponent's monster. If you take control of (2), after the chain has finished resolving, you are (2)'s controller. Therefore, if (2)'s has a Trigger effect on summon, you can activate its effect at this time<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You activate the "take control of 1 monster your opponent controls until the End Phase" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25311006">"Triple Tactics Talent"</span>, and your opponent activated the "immediately after this effect resolves, Link Summon 1 Link Monster using materials you control, including this card" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65741786">"I:P Masquerena"</span> in response. As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> is Link Summoned immediately after the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65741786">"I:P Masquerena"</span> resolves, and You gain control of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> when resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25311006">"Triple Tactics Talent"</span>. After the chain has finished resolving (at the time when the Trigger Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> can be activated), you are <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span>'s controller. Therefore, you can activate its effect at this time.
