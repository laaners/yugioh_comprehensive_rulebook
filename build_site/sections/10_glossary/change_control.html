<ul>
  <li>
    Cards that switch control are treated as cards of their current controller. They can also be used to pay costs or for Special Summons like Fusion Summons, Synchro Summons, Xyz Summons or Link Summons<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card on the field that has changed control later leaves the field, it is moved to the owner's location<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you take control of your opponent's monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If control of a monster that was stolen from the Extra Monster Zone is returned, it is not returned to the Extra Monster Zone of the owner, and is instead placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the previous controller. If there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
