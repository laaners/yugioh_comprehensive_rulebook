    Cards that switch control are treated as cards of their current controller. They can also be used to pay costs or for Special Summons like Fusion Summons, Synchro Summons, Xyz Summons or Link Summons<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card on the field that has changed control later leaves the field, it is moved to the owner's location<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have no available Main Monster Zones, you cannot activate an effect that would take control of an opponent's monster<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. Vice versa, you cannot activate an effect that gives control of a monster if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have 5 monsters in your Main Monster Zones before the resolution of an effect that switches control of a monster, the monster that would switch control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. In that case, it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br />If there are no available Main Monster Zones on my opponent's field, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span> that gives my opponent control of a "Tindangle" monster on my field?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span> that gives your opponent control of a "Tindangle" monster on your field cannot be activated if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones. Furthermore, when resolving that effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span>, if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones, the targeted "Tindangle" monster cannot change control and it is destroyed. (That monster is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect, so even if the destroyed monster is <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="31759689">"Tindangle Hound"</span>, its effect that activates when it is destroyed by battle or card effect cannot be activated.)

    If you take control of your opponent's monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If control of a monster that was stolen from the Extra Monster Zone is returned, it is not returned to the Extra Monster Zone of the owner, and is instead placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the previous controller. If there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

<h3>Changing control and Trigger effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Monsters changing control after their Trigger effect meets its activation condition can activate their effects after they've changed control (in which case the player who took control of the monster activates it)<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      <u>Question:</u><br />I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span> in my Graveyard, banishing <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> as a cost from my Graveyard and targeting my opponent's <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span>. When resolving this effect, I gain control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span>.<br />In this case, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> to banish 1 card each from my opponent's field and Graveyard since <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77235086">"Cyber Angel Benten"</span> has been banished?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In the given situation, you can activate the effect of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="96633955">"Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"</span> you gained control of due the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="99427357">"Cyber Angel Natasha"</span>.

    You activate a card (1) that takes control of an opponent monster as Chain Link 1. (1) does not target. Your opponent activates as Chain Link 2 an effect that summons a monster (2). The chain resolves backwards, (2) is special summoned first, then with (1) you take control of an opponent's monster. If you take control of (2), after the chain has finished resolving, you are (2)'s controller. Therefore, if (2)'s has a Trigger effect on summon, you can activate its effect at this time<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.

      <u>Question:</u><br />I activate the "take control of 1 monster your opponent controls until the End Phase" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25311006">"Triple Tactics Talent"</span>, and my opponent activated the "immediately after this effect resolves, Link Summon 1 Link Monster using materials you control, including this card" effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65741786">"I:P Masquerena"</span> in response.<br />As a result, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> is Link Summoned immediately after the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="65741786">"I:P Masquerena"</span> resolves, and I gain control of that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> when resolving the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25311006">"Triple Tactics Talent"</span>.<br />In this case, which player can activate the "if this card is Link Summoned using a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster as material" Trigger Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span>?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />After the chain has finished resolving (at the time when the Trigger Effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span> can be activated), you are <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29301450">"S:P Little Knight"</span>'s controller.
