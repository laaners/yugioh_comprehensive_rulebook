<ul>
  <li>Cards that switch control are treated as cards of their current controller. They can also be used to pay costs or for Special Summons like Fusion Summons, Synchro Summons, Xyz Summons or Link Summons.</li>
  <li>If a card on the field that has changed control later leaves the field, it is moved to the owner's location.</li>
  <li>If you have no available Main Monster Zones, you cannot activate an effect that would take control of an opponent's monster.</li>
  <li>
    if you have 5 monsters in your Main Monster Zones before the resolution of an effect that switches control of a monster, the monster that would switch control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. In that case, it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect.
    <br />
    Example: After you take control of an opponent's monster with the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98045062">"Enemy Controller"</span> that says "take control of that target until the End Phase", if the opponent has no available Main Monster Zones, the monster whose control would return is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
  </li>
  <li>If control of a monster in the Extra Monster Zone switches to the opponent, it is placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the opponent.</li>
  <li>If control of a monster that was stolen from the Extra Monster Zone is returned, it is not returned to the Extra Monster Zone of the owner, and is instead placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the previous controller. If there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
