          During your Main Phase: You can Special Summon this card from your hand to your opponent's field in face-down Defense Position. If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can add 1 "Mimighoul" Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Mimighoul Dragon" once per turn.

  <li>
    Cards that switch control are treated as cards of their current controller. They can also be used to pay costs or for Special Summons like Fusion Summons, Synchro Summons, Xyz Summons or Link Summons<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a card on the field that has changed control later leaves the field, it is moved to the owner's location<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you take control of your opponent's monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If control of a monster that was stolen from the Extra Monster Zone is returned, it is not returned to the Extra Monster Zone of the owner, and is instead placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the previous controller. If there are no available Main Monster Zones, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have 5 monsters in your Main Monster Zones before the resolution of an effect that switches control of a monster, the monster that would switch control is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. In that case, it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.

      <u>Question:</u><br />If there are no available Main Monster Zones on my opponent's field, can I activate the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span> that gives my opponent control of a "Tindangle" monster on my field?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span> that gives your opponent control of a "Tindangle" monster on your field cannot be activated if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones. Furthermore, when resolving that effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="9547962">"Euler's Circuit"</span>, if your opponent has no available Main Monster Zones, the targeted "Tindangle" monster cannot change control and it is destroyed. (That monster is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect, so even if the destroyed monster is <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="31759689">"Tindangle Hound"</span>, its effect that activates when it is destroyed by battle or card effect cannot be activated.)
