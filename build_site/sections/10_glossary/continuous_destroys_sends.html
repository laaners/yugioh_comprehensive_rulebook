    A card that self-destroys if a monster(s) with specific properties is not face-up, will self-destruct itself even if those monsters are used as materials to summon monsters with the same specific properties<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup

      <summary>Example</summary>
      While <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25407643">"Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters"</span> is face-up on my field, if you send all of your Spellcaster monsters to the Graveyard as Synchro Material, then Synchro Summon a Spellcaster monster, you do not control any Spellcaster monsters while performing the Synchro Summoning procedure. Therefore, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25407643">"Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters"</span> will be destroyed. Similarly, if you use all of your Spellcaster monsters as Xyz Material, then Xyz Summon a Spellcaster monster, you do not control any Spellcaster monsters while performing the Xyz Summoning procedure. Therefore, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25407643">"Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters"</span> will be destroyed.

    Continuous(-like) Effects apply before the effect at activation even begins resolving, a continuous Spell/Trap that has an effect at activation will not resolve successfully if it has a continuous self-destruct/self-send<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
    <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      You control a Set <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>. If you control a non-"Infernoid" monster, you can active it. If you choose to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span>'s effect that sends "Infernoid" monsters to the Graveyard as part of the card activation, before that effect begins resolving, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94432298">"Void Launch"</span> will be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect. As a result, you will then be unable to send "Infernoid" monsters from your Deck to the Graveyard.
