<h3>Negated Monsters' Effects and being used as Material</h3>
<p>
  Unclassified effects that apply when a card is used as material still apply if the card's effects on the field are negated.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="52323874">"Raidraptor - Fiend Eagle"</span> is Xyz Summoned using a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45184165">"Raidraptor - Skull Eagle"</span> that had its effects negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="97268402">"Effect Veiler"</span>, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45184165">"Raidraptor - Skull Eagle"</span> is applied, and will be activated as the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="52323874">"Raidraptor - Fiend Eagle"</span>. When it resolves, the ATK is increased by 300 as usual.

<h3>Normal monsters gain effect</h3>
<p>
  If a monster that is not an Effect Monster gains an effect by the effect of another card that says "gains this effect [effect]", that monster is treated as an Effect Monster.
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    Since a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="71594310">"Gem-Knight Pearl"</span> Xyz Summoned by using <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67120578">"Gagaga Head"</span> as Xyz Materials gains the effect that says "● If it is Xyz Summoned: Draw 1 card.", it is treated as an Effect Monster.
