<p><strong>Interaction with other card effects</strong></p>

<h3>Copies stop being unaffected the moment they stop existing</h3>
<p>
  A card (1) is unaffected by cards' effects. If (1) leaves the field, for example by paying a cost, (1) stops being unaffected by cards' effects.
  <br />
  Example: I activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87639778">"Harpie's Feather Storm"</span> (1) during this turn, and its effect "that negates any monster effect activated by my opponent is applying". In this situation, if my opponent uses <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27243130">"Forbidden Lance"</span> (2) to make their <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> (3) unaffected by Spell/Trap effects, and then activates its effect draws 2 cards by Tributing it, the effect of (2) stops applying and (1) is not treated as an effect that affects the monster on the field. Therefore, the effect of (3) is negated by (1).

<h3>Counters</h3>
<p>Placing a counter affects the monster:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A monster (1) that has a counter placed on it and an effect is applying to all monsters with that counter (2). Even if (1) becomes unaffected by cards' effects, the counter is not removed and (2) keeps applying and affecting (1).</li>
  <li>A monster (1) is unaffected or becomes unaffected by cards' effects. Subsequent effects that try to put counters on (1) will not put any counter on (1).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    A monster has had a "Cubic Counter" placed on it by the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15610297">"Vijam the Cubic Seed"</span>. Once a monster has had a "Cubic Counter" placed on it, even if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49032236">"Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"</span> is then applied to the monster, the "Cubic Counter" is not removed. That monster remains unable to attack, and its effects remain negated. Conversely, if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="49032236">"Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"</span> has already been applied to a monster, and that monster then battles a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="15610297">"Vijam the Cubic Seed"</span> whose effect then resolves, no "Cubic Counter" will be placed on the monster (As a result, its effects will not be negated, and it will still be able to attack).

<h3>Unaffected by activated effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Monsters which are "unaffected by activated effects" will be unaffected by any effect that is applied when the Chain Link formed by an activation resolves. However, any other effect will apply to them normally.</li>
  <li>
    Continuous/lingering effects that begin applying when the Chain Link formed by the card activation resolves, these effects will continue to apply to monsters afterwards. Therefore, these effects can affect monsters that are "unaffected by activated effects".
    <br />
    Example: the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="83326048">"Dimensional Barrier"</span> will negate the effects of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span>, and the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36975314">"Crackdown"</span> will take control of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Similarly, effects that apply later (delayed effects) also applies after the Chain Link formed by their activation has finished resolving. Therefore, they can also affect monsters that are "unaffected by activated effects".
    <br />
    Example: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44146295">"Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"</span>'s effect will destroy <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37542782">"Cyberdark End Dragon"</span> during the End Phase.
  </li>
</ul>
