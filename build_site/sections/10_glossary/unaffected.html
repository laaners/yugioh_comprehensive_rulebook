      You activated <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87639778">"Harpie's Feather Storm"</span> during this turn, and its effect "that negates any monster effect activated by your opponent is applying". In this situation, if your opponent uses <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27243130">"Forbidden Lance"</span> to make their <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> unaffected by Spell/Trap effects, and then activates its effect draws 2 cards by Tributing it, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="27243130">"Forbidden Lance"</span> stops applying and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87639778">"Harpie's Feather Storm"</span> is not treated as an effect that affects the monster on the field. Therefore, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="45812361">"Cardcar D"</span> is negated by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87639778">"Harpie's Feather Storm"</span>.

      When resolving <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48216773">"Compulsory Escape Device"</span>, your opponent can choose <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="86188410">"Elemental HERO Wildheart"</span>. In this case, it is not returned to the Deck, but remains on the field (if the opponent selected a monster that is affected by Trap Cards, it is returned to the Deck as usual).
