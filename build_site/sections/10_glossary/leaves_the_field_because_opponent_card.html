    Some cards have effects that activate when they or another card(s) "leave the field". For example, these effects activate when a monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.

      <summary>Example</summary>
      You control a Fusion Summoned <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44146295">"Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"</span>, and your opponent Tributes it to Special Summon <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36956512">"Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju"</span> to my field. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44146295">"Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"</span> is considered to have left the field by the opponent and it can activate its effect. Also, if your opponent sends that <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44146295">"Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"</span> to the Graveyard as Link Material for the Link Summon of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="98127546">"Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"</span>, that effect can be activated as well.
