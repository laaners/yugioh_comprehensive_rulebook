<h3>Attack all once each</h3>
<p>If a monster (1) can attack all opponent's monsters once each, if it attacks a monster (2) but then its attack is redirected to another monster (3), (1) cannot attack again (2). Furthermore, (3) which has been made the attack target instead of (2), if (3) has not been destroyed by battle after the attack redirection, (1) cannot attack again (3).</p>
