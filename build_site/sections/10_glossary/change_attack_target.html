    When an effect that changes attack target on attack declaration is applied, Damage Step is entered and <strong>damage calculation</strong> is performed while the effect is resolving<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >. This means that:
    <ul>
      <li>Effects of cards that have to activate before damage calculation <strong>cannot</strong> be activated.</li>
      <li>Effects of cards that have to activate during damage calculation <strong>cannot</strong> be activated</li>
      <li>Effects of cards that have to activate at the end of the Damage Step <strong>can</strong> be activated.</li>

      <u>Question:</u><br />When the second effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63767246">"Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"</span> is applied, can the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37742478">"Honest"</span> be activated before damage calculation? During damage calculation, can <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="54773234">"Forbidden Scripture"</span> be activated?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />The effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63767246">"Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"</span> makes it the attack target, then performs damage calculation, so while the effect is resolving, the Damage Step is entered and damage calculation are conducted. Therefore, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37742478">"Honest"</span> cannot be activated before damage calculation, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="54773234">"Forbidden Scripture"</span> cannot be activated during damage calculation. However, effects that activate after damage calculation or at the end of the Damage Step can be activated normally.
