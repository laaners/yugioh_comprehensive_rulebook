    Changing from only-Monster to only-Spell/Trap creates a new copy: similary, if (1) targets (2) while in a Monster Zone but (2) is placed in the Spell/Trap Zone, (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) does not resolve successfully<sup><a href="#summon_from_spell_trap_zone-2">[1]</a></sup

      <u>Question:</u><br /><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94415058">"Stargazer Magician"</span> is face-up in my Monster Zone, and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42378577">"Pendulum Switch"</span> is face-up in my Spell &amp; Trap Zone. In this situation, if my opponent activates <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> and targets <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94415058">"Stargazer Magician"</span>, but I chain the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42378577">"Pendulum Switch"</span> that places it in the Pendulum Zone, what happens?<br /><u>Answer:</u><br />In this scenario, when <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span> resolves, the targeted <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94415058">"Stargazer Magician"</span> will be in your Pendulum Zone due to the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="42378577">"Pendulum Switch"</span>. In this case, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="94415058">"Stargazer Magician"</span> is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4178474">"Raigeki Break"</span>, so it is not destroyed.
