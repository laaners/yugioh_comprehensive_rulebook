    If a part of an effect asks to perform an action, and the effect of another card says that same action cannot be performed, in most cases the effect that says "cannot" takes precedence<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
    <br />
    Example: if the two effects "any card sent to the GY is banished instead" and "neither player can banish cards" are applying both simultaneously, cards sent to the Graveyard will not be banished and are sent to the Graveyard normally<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
