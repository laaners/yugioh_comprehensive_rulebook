<h3>Activation Location</h3>
<p>If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location (On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck) changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate.</p>
