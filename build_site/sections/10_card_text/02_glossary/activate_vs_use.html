<h3>Activate vs Use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cards that state "You can only activate this card once per turn/Duel" can be activated again in the same turn/Duel if their activation is negated.
    <ul>
      <li>For example: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="87025064">"Silver's Cry"</span> (which can only be activated once per turn) and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="48179391">"The Seal of Orichalcos"</span> (which can only be activated once per Duel) can be activated again during the same turn or Duel if another copy had its activation negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77414722">"Magic Jammer"</span>), but not if only its effect was negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63767246">"Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"</span>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Effects that state "You can only use this effect once per turn/Duel" cannot be activated again in the same turn/Duel, even if their activation is negated.
    <ul>
      <li>For example: <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="44335251">"Souleating Oviraptor"</span> can only use each of its effects once per turn, while <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="18789533">"Dotscaper"</span> can only use each of its effects once per Duel, even if these monsters' effects are negated by a card such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="40605147">"Solemn Strike"</span>.</li>
    </ul>
