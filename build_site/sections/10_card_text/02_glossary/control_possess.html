<h3>Control/Possess</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cards you "control" are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell &amp; Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone.</li>
  <li>Cards in your "possession" include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the field, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller's side of the field. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner.</p>
