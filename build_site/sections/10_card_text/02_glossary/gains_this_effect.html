<h3>Gains this effect</h3>

<h4>Normal monsters gain effect</h4>

<p>
  If a monster that is not an Effect Monster gains an effect by the effect of another card that says "gains this effect […]", that monster is treated as an Effect Monster.
  <br />
  Example: Since a <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="71594310">"Gem-Knight Pearl"</span> Xyz Summoned by using <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="67120578">"Gagaga Head"</span> as Xyz Materials gains the effect that says "● If it is Xyz Summoned: Draw 1 card.", it is treated as an Effect Monster.
