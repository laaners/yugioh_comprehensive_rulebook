<h3>Leaves the field</h3>
<p>Some monsters have effects that activate when they "leave the field". For example, these effects activate when the monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck.</p>
<p>When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck.</p>
