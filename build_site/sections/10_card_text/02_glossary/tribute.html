<h4>Tributes for a Tribute Summon</h4>

<p>Sending monsters on the field to the Graveyard for a Tribute Summon is called Tributing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Face-down monsters on the field can also be Tributed.</li>
  <li>The Tributes are performed at the time the Tribute Summon is declared, before the monster that would be Normal Summoned/Set is placed on the field. Even if the Tribute Summon is negated, the Tributed monsters are sent to the Graveyard normally.</li>
  <li>You can only Tribute monsters you control.</li>
  <li>Monster Tokens on the field can also be Tributed. In this case, the tokens are not sent to the Graveyard and they are removed from the Duel.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards treated as monsters on the field can also be Tributed. In that case, that Tributed Trap Card is sent to the Graveyard, providing no particular effect is being applied.</li>
  <li>If <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29549364">"Mask of Restrict"</span> has been activated, so that monsters cannot be Tributed, a Tribute Summon cannot be performed.</li>
  <li>Monsters that you control in the Extra Monster Zones can also be used as tributes for a Tribute Summon.</li>
  <li>Even if <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> or something similar is being applied, so that monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, monsters can still be Tributed. In that case, the Tributed monsters are not sent to the Graveyard and are banished instead.</li>
</ul>
