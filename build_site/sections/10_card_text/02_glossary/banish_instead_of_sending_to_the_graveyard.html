<h3>Banish instead of sending to the Graveyard</h3>

<h4>Interaction with Pendulum monsters</h4>

<p>If an effect that says "Any monster sent to the Graveyard is banished instead." is being applied when a Pendulum Monster placed in the Pendulum Zone is destroyed, since it exists on the field as a Spell Card, it is not banished and it is added to the Extra Deck</p>

<p>If an effect like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="30241314">"Macro Cosmos"</span> is being applied, so that (all kinds of) cards that would be sent to the Graveyard are banished, the effect text takes precedence and Pendulum Monsters are not added to the Extra Deck and are banished instead.</p>

<h4>Banish only monsters and paying cost</h4>
<p>When the effect "any Monster sent to the GY is banished instead" is applying you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cannot</strong> activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster to the Graveyard as a cost.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cannot</strong> activate a card or effect that send cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard as cost as there may be monster cards among them<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can</strong> activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster Card not treated as a Monster (for example treated as an Equip Spell Card) to the Graveyard as a cost<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Banish vs cannot banish</h4>
<p>If the two effects "any card sent to the GY is banished instead" and "neither player can banish cards" are applying both simultaneously, cards sent to the Graveyard will not be banished and are sent to the Graveyard normally.</p>
