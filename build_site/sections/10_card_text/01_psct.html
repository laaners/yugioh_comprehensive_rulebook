<h2>Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)</h2>
<p>
  Problem-Solving Card Text (often abbreviated PSCT) is a method of writing card text used for prints released from July 8, 2011 onward. The purpose of Problem-Solving Card Text is to specify card effects to the point that most situations can be resolved by logically interpreting the card text<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >.
</p>

<p>Problem-Solving Card Text uses specific words with very particular meanings in the context of gameplay. How to interpret the text is important to understanding how to apply card text to the game.</p>

<p>This interpretation can only be applied for cards that use Problem-Solving Card Text. Cards that were printed with earlier text may use some of the same terms or structures, but this does not necessarily mean that they work as if they were Problem-Solving Card Text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    All card effects that make a Chain Link include a colon ":" or a semicolon ";" somewhere in their text (possibly both). If a card effect does not use either, it does not make a Chain Link<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The activation of a Spell or Trap Card always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that resolves with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
        >. This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card's text.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>colon</strong> ":" describes <strong>activation conditions</strong> (limits on when or how often a card or effect can be activated<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
    >). These conditions only need to be met when the card is activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup
    >.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conditions other than target requirements that have to be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a separate sentence after the effect sentence (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="17259470">"Zombie Master"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="12538374">"Treeborn Frog"</span>)<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Text before the <strong>semicolon</strong> ";" (but after the colon, if any) describes anything that happens when that card or effect is activated (such as <strong>costs and targeting</strong><sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
    ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
    >).
  </li>
  <li>
    Built-In Special Summons (other than Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link) are denoted by parentheses "()" stating the location from which the monster can be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards with bulleted effects (‚óè) that resolve in the same Chain Link specify whether they resolve simultaneously or sequentially (if sequentially, effects are applied in the order they are listed). In these cases, each effect activated resolves independent of the success of the other(s).
    <ul>
      <li>The text "in sequence" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied sequentially (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="25524823">"Gravekeeper's Oracle"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="76224717">"Advance Zone"</span>).</li>
      <li>The text "(simultaneously)" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied simultaneously (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21502796">"Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="37390589">"Kunai with Chain"</span>).</li>
      <li>If neither is specified, the effects each make separate Chain Links (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36898537">"Metaphys Horus"</span>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Activation condition/requirement</h3>
<p>An activation condition, also known as its activation requirement, is the set of conditions that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unless otherwise specified, the activation conditions only need to be satisfied when the card is activated, not when it resolves.</li>
  <li>On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the activation condition is written before a colon ":", at the start of a card effect.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Activation_condition">Yugipedia</a>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>A cost is an action that must be performed in order to activate a card or effect, to perform another action, or to keep a card on the field. This is distinct from activation requirements, which are requirements that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Costs usually involve the player making a sacrifice of some type, such as paying Life Points (e.g. <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="3819470">"Seven Tools of the Bandit"</span> requires the player to pay 1000 Life Points), discarding, Tributing, banishing, detaching a card(s) or sending a card(s) to the Graveyard</li>
  <li>If a cost cannot be fully paid, none of the cost can be paid and the effect cannot be activated.</li>
  <li>A cost is not an effect. If a card is moved to a different location due to a cost, cards and effects that can only be activated when the card is moved by a card effect cannot be activated. For example, the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77723643">"Shaddoll Dragon"</span> cannot be activated if it is sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="63356631">"Phoenix Wing Wind Blast"</span>.</li>
  <li>Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost).</li>
  <li>On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the cost is written before a semicolon ";", at the start of a card effect or after the activation condition.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Maintenance cost</h4>
<p>A maintenance cost is a cost required to keep a card on the field. They are typically paid during a player's Standby Phase or End Phase. If a player does not, or cannot, pay the maintenance cost of a card, then it will destroy itself (with the exception of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="14258627">"Gaia Plate the Earth Giant"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="70875955">"Aerial Recharge"</span>, which simply send themselves to the Graveyard).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintenance costs are not effects, so they cannot be negated and do not activate or start a Chain Link; even if a card like <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="82732705">"Skill Drain"</span>" or <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="77585513">"Jinzo"</span> is on the field and negating the card's effects, its maintenance cost still needs to be paid.</li>
  <li>Cards such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="4694209">"Card Guard"</span> and <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="7153114">"Field Barrier"</span> cannot protect these cards from destroying themselves due to not paying their maintenance cost, since it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>mandatory</strong> maintenance costs (such as <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61740673">"Imperial Order"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="36995273">"Degenerate Circuit"</span>, <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="90590303">"Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"</span>), the player does not have the option of choosing not to pay the cost and letting the card be destroyed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a mandatory maintenance cost requires LP and the player has exactly the specified amount left, since they must pay, they lose the Duel when the cost comes up due to reaching 0 LP (e.g. when the controller of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="61740673">"Imperial Order"</span> happens to have 700 LP during the Standby Phase).</li>

<h3>Target</h3>
<p>Targeting is the action of designating which specific cards are affected or used by card effects at the activation of a card effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cards can be targeted if they are on the field, in the Graveyard, or banished. Cards in the hand, Main Deck, Extra Deck<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >, or attached as Xyz Material cannot be targeted.
  </li>
  <li>In Problem-Solving Card Text, cards and effects that target always explicitly state that they target: a card targets if and only if it uses the word "target".</li>
  <li>If a card or effect targets, its targets must be chosen when it is activated.</li>
  <li>You cannot choose to use a card or effect that targets unless there is a card for it to target.</li>
  <li>
    Equip Spell Cards always target, but activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If a card was targeted by a card or effect, but when the effect resolves that target has changed location, the target is no longer valid and cannot be affected as the target<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup
  >. The player does not get to change their target or select another target at resolution.

<h4>Cannot "create" target through cost</h4>
<p>In order to activate a card (1) with a cost to pay and targets another card (2) for its effect (for example target (2) and Summon it from the Graveyard), a correct target (2) must be present (on the field, in the Graveyard, ...) before attempting (1)'s activation. Even if a valid target would be created after paying (1)'s cost, (1) cannot be activated.</p>

<h4>that target vs it</h4>
<p>The terms "that target" or "those targets" and "it" or "they/them" have specific meanings in the resolution of the effect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    "That target" and "those targets" indicate that targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution to be affected. "Both (those) targets" and "all three targets" indicate that
    <strong>all</strong> targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution for any of them to be affected.
  </li>
  <li>"It" and "they/them" indicate that the targets do not need to meet the target requirements at resolution, only when targeted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conjunctives</h3>
<p>
  The conjunctives "and", "and if you do", "also", and "then" have specific meanings<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
  >:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In "Do A, <strong>then</strong> do B", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do A <strong>and</strong> B", both A and B happen simultaneously. BOTH A and B are required. If you cannot do both, you do nothing<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do A, <strong>and if you do</strong>, do B", both A and B happen simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    In "Do A, <strong>also</strong> do B", both A and B happen simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup
    >.
  </li>
  <li>In "Do A, <strong>also, after that</strong>, do B", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur (This conjunctive was never discussed in the Problem-Solving Card Text articles, as it was not introduced until 2014).</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no conjunctive that indicates both parts of the effect are required while also indicating that the parts are not simultaneous. While this relationship is rare, it does occur for some effects - in particular, Fusion Summoning and Ritual Summoning effects, which normally text structures unique to that Summoning method, which do not use conjunctives at all for that part of their text. The card <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="34834619">"Luminous Dragon Ritual"</span> uniquely indicates this relationship with the conjunctive "and" followed by "after that" at the end of the second part of the effect.</p>

<h4>Banishing a token is a conjunction success</h4>
<p>If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).</p>

<h4>0 ATK/DEF reduction, and conjunction success</h4>
<p>A card's (1) effect which lowers a stat of a monster with action A and then does an action B, if action A applies to a monster (2) whose stat is lower than 1000 (even 0), then B <strong>will</strong> apply (even if (2)'s ATK is already 0, B will apply even if A is required such as "if you do" conjunctive).</p>
