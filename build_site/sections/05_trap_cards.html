<h1>Trap cards</h1>
<p>Trap Cards will help you out with different effects, just like Spell Cards. The big difference between them is that you can activate Trap Cards during your opponent's turn. Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you can activate it at any time after that-starting from the beginning of the next turn.</p>

<p>Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the field like Trap Cards. However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent's turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase. You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the field to bluff your opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.</p>

<h2>Activating and Setting Trap Cards</h2>

<p>Activating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activating Trap Cards starts a chain. With the exception of Counter Traps, they are of Spell Speed 2. Counter Traps are of Spell Speed 3.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards must be Set. However, if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="21593977">"Makyura the Destructor"</span> that says "you can activate Trap Cards from your hand." is applied, you can activate Trap Cards during either player's turn when you have priority.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards Set on the field can be activated during either player's turn when that player has priority.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards cannot be activated during the turn in which they are Set. However, if the effect of <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-name="29762407">"Temple of the Kings"</span> that says "You can activate 1 Trap Card the turn it was Set." is being applied, they can be activated just like Trap Cards Set in previous turns.</li>
  <li>If a Set Trap Card is activated, it is changed from being face-down to face-up in the Spell & Trap Zone.</li>
  <li>If a Trap Card is activated, cards that negate the activation of Trap Cards can be activated in a chain.</li>
  <li>A Trap Card that had its activation negated is sent to the Graveyard, providing no particular effect is being applied. In that case, the Trap Card that is sent to the Graveyard is not treated as being sent from the hand or field to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>Activated Trap Cards are treated as being face-up on the field.</li>
  <li>Trap Cards are sent to the Graveyard after applying their effects, with the exception of Continuous Traps and some Normal Traps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During their Main Phase, once the turn player has priority and they do not wish to activate or resolve an effect, the turn player can place Trap Cards from their hand face-down.</li>
  <li>Placing Trap Cards face-down is called Setting them.</li>
  <li>The information of face-down Trap Cards, including whether they are a Spell or Trap Card or not, is private to the opponent. The controller of those face-down cards can always verify them.</li>
  <li>If there are no available Spell & Trap Zones, Trap Cards cannot be Set.</li>
</ul>
