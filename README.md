## The Game Mat/Dueling Field
The Game Mat helps you organize your cards during a Duel. When you use your cards you place them on the Game Mat. Different kinds of cards are placed in different Zones.

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/game_mat.png" width=800 />
</div>

1. Main Monster Zone
2. Spell & Trap Zone and Pendulum Zone
3. Graveyard (GY)
4. Deck
5. Field Zone
6. Extra Deck
7. Extra Monster Zone

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### The field

If an effect says "the field", it refers one of the following locations:
- Main Monster Zones
- Extra Monster Zones
- Spell & Trap Zones
- Pendulum Zones
- Field Zones

If an effect simply says "card(s) on the field" without specifying yours or the opponent's, the effect can affect both player's Main Monster Zones, Extra Monster Zones, Spell & Trap Zones, Field Zones and Pendulum Zones.

If an effect simply says "Monster Zones" without specifying Main or Extra Monster Zones, it affects both Main Monster Zones and Extra Monster Zones.

        </li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Main Monster Zone
This is where you put your monsters when they're played.
- You can have up to 5 cards here.
- There are 3 ways to position your Monster Cards:
  1. Face-up Attack Position
  2. Face-up Defense Position
  3. Face-down Defense Position

   Place the card upright for Attack Position, and sideways for Defense Position.
- A monster placed in a Monster Zone cannot be moved to a different Monster Zone unless by an effect.

        </li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Extra Monster Zone
This is where you put your monsters that are Summoned to the field by special methods from the Extra Deck
- Normally, each player can only use 1 of these Zones. A monster placed in this Zone does not count towards the 5-monster limit of your Main Monster 
Zone.
- Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Monsters can be first Summoned from the Extra Deck to any of your Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#extra_monster_zone-2">[2]</a></sup>. They do not have to be Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone or a spot that a Link Monster is pointing to. You can still Summon a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz Monster from the Extra Deck to your Extra Monster Zone if you want to, though.
- The restrictions requiring an Extra Monster Zone or Link Monster pointing still apply to Link Monsters and Pendulum Monsters that are Summoned from the Extra Deck.
- An Extra Monster Deck Zone in which no monster has been placed is not treated as either yours or the opponent's. Only if a monster is placed in a zone, that zone is treated as being a zone of the controller of that monster.
- Monsters that are not Special Summoned from the Extra Deck cannot be placed in the Extra Monster Zone.
- An Extra Monster Zone in which a monster has been placed is also treated as a Monster Zone of the controller of that monster.
- Monsters placed in the Extra Monster Zone cannot be moved to another zone unless an effect or resolution is applied.
- If a monster that has been Special Summoned from the Extra Deck into the Extra Monster Zone is later sent to the Graveyard or banished and later would be Special Summoned, it is not Special Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone and is Special Summoned into a Main Monster zone instead.
- The other Extra Monster Zone from the point of view of each Extra Monster Zone is not treated as "the adjacent zone".
- If control of a monster in the Extra Monster Zone changes
  - If control of a monster placed in an Extra Monster Zone switches to the other player's field, it is placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the player who gained control.
  - If control of a monster that was transfered to the opponent from an Extra Monster Zone returns, it is not placed in the original Extra Monster Zone, and it is placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the player who regained control. If there is no available Main Monster Zone, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Spell & Trap Zone
This is where you put Spell & Trap Cards.
- You can have up to 5 cards here.
- You place them here face-up to activate them, or place them face-down. 
- A card placed in a Spell & Trap Zone cannot be moved to a different Spell & Trap Zone, unless by an effect.
- Since Field Spell Cards can only be placed in the Field Zone, they cannot be placed in the Spell & Trap Zone.
- If a Monster Card is placed in the Spell & Trap Zone by some effect or resolution, it is treated as a Spell or Trap Card (the effects will specify which kind of Spell or Trap).
- Pendulum Monster Cards can be activated in the leftmost and rightmost Zones as Spells. This causes the Zone you use to also become a Pendulum Zone for as long as the Pendulum Monster Card is there.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Pendulum Zone

This is the place where Pendulum Monsters activated as Spell Cards are placed in. The left-most and right-most of the 5 Spell & Trap Zones on the field are also treated as Pendulum Zones. However, they are only treated as Pendulum Zones as long as there is a Pendulum Monster in them that has been activated from the hand as a Spell Card on that has been placed in them by an effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone. Furthermore, Pendulum Monsters placed here through these methods are treated as "cards in the Pendulum Zone(s)".
- The only places in which Pendulum Monsters can be activated as Spell Cards from the hand or placed by an effect that places cards in a Pendulum Zone are the left-most and right-most of the 5 Spell & Trap Zones on the field.
- New cards cannot be placed in a Pendulum Zone that already has a card placed on it.
- Pendulum Monsters placed in the Pendulum Zone are not treated as monsters and are treated as Spell Cards, as well as cards in the Spell & Trap Zone. But they are still "Monster Cards".
- Only the Pendulum Monster cards that have been placed in a Pendulum Zone by being activated from the hand as Spell Cards or placed there by an effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone are treated as "cards in the Pendulum Zone". For example: A Pendulum Monster treated as an Equip Card by an effect like the effect of Relinquished that says which is placed in a Pendulum Zone is not treated as "a card in the Pendulum Zone". Therefore, its Pendulum Effects cannot be used and a Pendulum Summon cannot be performed.
- Effects like Wavering Eyes that "destroy all cards in the Pendulum Zones" cannot destroy Pendulum Monsters that have been placed in the Pendulum Zones by methods other than being activated from the hand as a Spell Card or by being placed there by a card effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone.
- If an Effect like the effect of Acrobatic Magician which says "When this card is destroyed by battle: You can place this card in your Pendulum Zone" places a card from outside the Pendulum Zone into a Pendulum Zone, it can place a card in either the left-most or right-most of the 5 Spell & Trap Zones that is available. If a card is placed by this method, that zone is also treated as a Pendulum Zone, and the card placed there is also treated as "a card in the Pendulum Zone".

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>


#### Field Zone
Special Spell Cards called Field Spell Cards are played here (activated face-up or set face-down).
- Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. 
- To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard.
- Field Spell Cards do not count towards the 5-card limit of your Spell & Trap Zone: they are not treated as cards in the Spell & Trap Zone, for example:
  - The effect of "Treeborn Frog" that can be activated if "You must control no Spell/Trap Cards to activate and to resolve this effect." cannot be activated if there is a Field Spell Card.
  - The effect of "Snow Plow Hustle Rustle" that says "When your opponent's monster declares a direct attack, if you control a card(s) in your Spell & Trap Card Zone:" cannot be activated if the only Spell & Trap Cards you control are in your Field Zone.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Graveyard
When Monster Cards are destroyed, and when Spell & Trap Cards are used, they're sent face-up to this space.
- The contents of both players' Graveyards are public knowledge: you and your opponent can look through both at any time during the Duel.
- The order of the cards in the Graveyard should not be changed.
- Graveyard is shortened in the card text to "GY".
- If multiple cards are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, it is the owner of those cards that decides the order in which they are placed in the Graveyard, regardless of the controller of the effect.
- If cards are sent to the Graveyard, they are always sent to the owner's Graveyard.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Deck Zone
Your Deck is placed face-down in this space.
- You draw cards from here to add to your hand.
- If a card effect requires you to reveal cards from your Deck, or look through it, shuffle it and put it back in this space afterwards.
- The cards in your Main Deck are always private. Aside from effects that let you search cards in the Deck like "add a card from the Deck to the hand" or "Special Summon a monster from the Deck", the order and information of cards in the Deck cannot be verified by either player.
- The number of cards in the Main Deck is public knowledge. Both players can always verify the number of cards in the Deck.
- If an effect that searches cards in the Deck is resolved, the Main Deck must always be shuffled after resolving that effect.
- If an effect only says "Deck", without specifying yours or the opponent's, that effect can only affect your Deck.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Extra Deck Zone
Place your Extra Deck face-down in this space.
- You can look at the cards in your own Extra Deck during the game.
- During a Duel, Extra Deck Monsters may be Summoned to the field from here using special methods.
- The face-down cards in the Extra Deck are private to the opponent.
- The number of cards in the Extra Deck is public knowledge. Both players can always verify the number of cards in both Extra Decks.

Regarding Pendulum Monster Cards:
- Pendulum Monster Cards that would be sent from the field to the Graveyard are placed face-up here.
- The Pendulum Monsters that were added to the Extra Deck face-up are public knowledge. Both players can always verify the face-up cards in both Extra Decks.

# Monster cards

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/monster_card.png" width=400 />
</div>

**1. Card Name**\
This is the card's name. When a card name is mentioned in card text it appears in quotations. If cards have the same name, they are considered to be the same card.

**2. Level**\
Count the number of stars here to find out the monster's Level. For Xyz Monsters, the number of stars is the Rank of the monster, and is on left.

**3. Attribute**
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/attributes.png" width=180 />
</div>

Every monster has an Attribute. This Attribute is sometimes important for card effects.

**4. Type**\
Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with specific abilities will have additional information here too, next to their Type.

**5. Card Number**\
A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.

**6. ATK (Attack Points)/DEF (Defense Points)**\
ATK is a monster's Attack Points and DEF is a monster's Defense Points. High Attack and Defense Points are good when battling!

**7. Card Description**\
Card effects are written here, describing the monster's special abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description of them written here that does not affect the game.

There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a simple slugfest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will not be enough. There are also monsters with strong special effects even though their ATK and DEF points are low. Therefore, your success in a Duel depends on how skillfully you can make use of the different kinds of cards.

				<li>Continuous Effect</li>
				<li>Ignition Effect</li>
				<li>Quick Effect</li>
				<li>Trigger Effect (including Flip)</li>
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Continuous Effect</th>
		<td>
			This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack"
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Ignition Effect</th>
		<td>
			You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target"
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Quick Effect</th>
		<td>
			These are special monster effects that you can activate even during your opponent's turn. These types of effects have a Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell Speed of 1.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "When an effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can target 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it."
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Trigger Effect</th>
		<td>
			These effects are activated at specific times, such as "during the Standby Phase" or "when this monster is destroyed".
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: Target 1 card on the field; destroy that target."
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Flip Effect</th>
		<td>
			Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word "FLIP:" on the card.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "FLIP: Draw 1 card."

### Summoning the monster you tribute is not possible

When activating a card (1) that has an effect that performs a Ritual Summon from the Graveyard for example, a valid Ritual Monster (2) must be present in the Graveyard. If you tribute a Ritual Monster (3) so that it meets the requirements to Summon (2) from the Graveyard, if (3) will be sent to the Graveyard as a result and (3) is also a valid target that can be Summoned with (1), you **cannot** Summon (3) from the Graveyard.

### Special Summon to the Main Monster Zones
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/link_main_monster.png" width=250 />
</div>
Link and Pendulum Monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck normally have to go in the Extra Monster Zone. But Link Monsters open up more Zones for you to use, because every Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster points to can also be used to Summon Link and Pendulum monsters from your Extra Deck.

Link and Pendulum Monsters that started in the Extra Deck, but later end up in the Graveyard (or are banished) and are Summoned from there, also go in the Main Monster Zones (and don't need a Link Monster to point to them).

### Vocabulary
Some common terms to know when dealing with Link Monsters:
- **Link Arrows**: these are the big red triangles surrounding the picture of the monster. Only the red ones are Link Arrows.
- **Link Rating**: the number in the lower right hand corner of a Link Monster where the DEF would normally be located. This is the number of Link Arrows the monster has, and also the number of Link Materials you need to use to Link Summon it.
- **Link Material**: these are the face-up monsters on your side of the field that you use to Link Summon.
- **points to**: the Monster Zones and/or monsters that are directly adjacent to the tip of a Link Arrow are the zones and/or monsters that Link Monster "points to". A Decode Talker placed in an Extra Monster Zone, for example, points to the Main Monster Zone directly above it, as well as the Main Monster Zones diagonally downwards to the left and right. A Decode Talker placed in the center Main Monster Zone does not point to anything, as there are no Monster Zones directly adjacent to the tip of its Link Arrows.
- **linked**: a monster is "linked" if one or both of the following is true:
  1. A Link Arrow is pointing to this monster.
  2. This monster is a Link Monster and one of its Link Arrows is pointing to another monster.
- **co-linked**: only Link Monsters can be "co-linked". Two Link Monsters are "co-linked" if they have Link Arrows that point at each other. In the following formation, Firewall Dragon is "co-linked" to 2 monsters: Link Spider and Honeybot.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Extra Link
In addition to being linked or co-linked, there's a special type of "linked" state that a monster can be in: "Extra Linked". Only Link Monsters can be Extra Linked, and this state only occurs when a series of co-linked Link Monsters is built that connects a Link Monster in an Extra Monster Zone to a Link Monster in the other Extra Monster Zone. Each monster in the series must be co-linked to each other monster it is linked to in the series.

In the example below, we've placed a series of co-linked monsters from the right-hand Extra Monster Zone over to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone where the opponent has Link Summoned "Decode Talker". Each of our Link Monsters is co-linked to each other Link Monster it's linked to in the series, so when we Link Summon the final monster in the series, each monster in the series becomes Extra Linked in addition to being co-linked and linked, including the opponent's "Decode Talker". Any Link Monster that is co-linked to one of the monsters in this series is also Extra Linked, even if it's not contributing towards making the monsters Extra Linked. For example, an extra "Honeybot" to the left or right of one of the "Firewall Dragons" would also be Extra Linked.

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/extra_link.png" width=500 />
</div>

Under normal circumstances you cannot occupy both Extra Monster Zones with monsters from your Extra Deck. There is one, and only one, exception to this rule: If Link Summoning to the second Extra Monster Zone would create a complete series of Extra Linked Link Monsters, you may Link Summon a monster to that Extra Monster Zone to complete that series. So in the example below, you are allowed to Link Summon a monster to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone if and only if that monster would be co-linked to the left-hand "Firewall Dragon", causing all of the monsters to become Extra Linked.

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/extra_link_2.png" width=500 />
</div>

**Link Monsters can be co-linked on diagonals**, an Extra Link with only three monsters is then possible as well.

### Link Monsters as Link material
Normally, 1 monster equals 1 Link Material. But when you use a Link Monster as material for another Link Summon, you can count it as either 1 monster, or as a number of monsters equal to its Link Rating. For example, if you want to Summon a Link 3 monster that requires 2 or more materials in its "recipe", you can either use 3 monsters (each counts as 1 material) or else a Link 2 Link Monster (counts as 1 or 2 materials) and a second monster (counts as 1 material).

		</li>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Defense
Link Monsters have no DEF and cannot ever be in Defense Position. They can't be changed to Defense Position by a card effect. They can't even be flipped into face-down Defense Position.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Change control
If you take control of your opponent's monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Non-monster card as material
As long as the materials meet the requirements of the Link Monster you want to Summon, you can use a Token or Trap Card that is treated as a monster as the Link Material.

# Summoning

There are several ways to play monsters onto the field. These ways can be categorized into 2 groups: actions that can be done only once per turn, and actions that can be done multiple times per turn:
1. **You can do one of these once per turn**:
   - Normal Summon
   - Normal Set
   - Tribute Summon
2. **You can do as many of these during a turn as you want**:
   - Flip Summon
   - Special Summon
   - Special Summon with a Card's Effect

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Normal Summon
This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a Monster Card from your hand onto the field in face-up Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters (unless they have a specific restriction), can be Summoned in this way.

*References*:
	<ol>
		<li>
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 24</a>
		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Normal Set
To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set.
- A monster Normal Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned.
- It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or flipped face-up by an attack or card effect.
- Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn.
- You cannot play a monster from your hand onto the field in face-up Defense Position

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Tribute Summon
For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes
<div align="center">

| Level 5, 6 | Level 7 or higher |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1 Tribute  | 2 Tributes        |

</div>

- If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned.
- When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Flip Summon

You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon.
- When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position.
- A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the field.
- You cannot use most monsters' effects until they are face-up

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Special Summon

Some monsters can be played onto the field without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Link Summons, Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have specific conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise specified, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the field in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position.

Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the field through the effect of another card.

If an effect that Summon states "Immediately after this effect resolves", it instructs a player to perform a Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link Summon at the **resolution** of the Chain Link.
- A monster summoned by such effects is **not** considered to have been "Special Summoned by an activated Monster/Spell/Trap effect"<sup><a href="#immediately_after_this_effect_resolves_summon-1">[1]</a></sup>
- The **effect or the activation** can be negated by cards that are able to negate "effects that include an effect that Special Summons a monster(s)"<sup><a href="#immediately_after_this_effect_resolves_summon-2">[2]</a></sup>
- The **Summon** of that monster(s) can be negated if the effect resolves as Chain Link 1<sup><a href="#immediately_after_this_effect_resolves_summon-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Properly Special Summon
This is different from "Special Summon Monsters." You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, Graveyard<sup><a href="#properly_special_summon-1">[1]</a></sup>, Spell/Trap Zone<sup><a href="#properly_special_summon-2">[2]</a></sup> unless it was properly Special Summoned first. For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned first, before they can be Special Summoned by another card's effect.

#### Flip Summon and Properly Special Summon
A monster (1) properly Special Summoned is on the field. If (1) is being flipped face-down by a card effect and then (1) is Flip Summoned, if a card effect negates (1)'s Flip Summon, (1) is still being treated as properly Special Summoned.

## Summon restrictions

### Summon restrictions and successful Summons

The restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon the turn you activate this card" only refers to monsters that were successfully Summoned. Same for "you can only Special Summon X once per turn" restrictions.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Summon restrictions and properties changing

A card (1) with the restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon except [...] monsters the turn you activate this card" applies its restrictions for the entire duration of the turn. Normally, if you Summon a monster (2) which violates the restriction of (1), then (1) cannot be activated. Similarly, if you activate (1) first (2) cannot be Summoned. But if:

- A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), then (1) can be activated **after** (2) has been Summoned.
- A card (3) has an effect that applies to (2) such that when (2) is Summoned it does not violate the restriction of (1), but you activate (1) **before** (2) is Summoned, then (2) cannot be Summoned anymore.

# Spell cards

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/spell_trap_card.png" width=400 />
</div>

**1. Card Name**\
Remember, cards with the same name are considered to be the same card, and you can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Main Deck and Side Deck combined.

**2. Type**\
Instead of having an Attribute symbol like Monster Cards, a Spell Card has the "SPELL 魔" symbol and a Trap Card has the "TRAP 罠" symbol.

**3. Icon**
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/spell_trap_icons.png" width=320 />
</div>

There are 6 types of icons that represent special properties a Spell or Trap Card may have. Spell and Trap Cards without an icon are called Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards.

**4. Card Description**\
Each card's activation conditions and effects are provided here.

**5. Card Number**\
A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.

Spell Cards can normally be activated only during your Main Phase, and help you out with different effects. Spell Cards have many powerful effects, like destroying other cards or strengthening monsters. Save these cards in your hand until you can get the best results out of them.

## Normal Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_normal.png" width=50>
	Normal Spell Cards have single-use effects. To use a Normal Spell Card, announce its activation to your opponent, placing it face-up on the field. If the activation succeeds, then you resolve the effect written on the card. After resolving the effect, send the card to the Graveyard.

## Ritual Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_ritual.png" width=50>
	These Spell Cards are used to perform Ritual Summons. Use these cards in the same way as you would use Normal Spell Cards.

## Continuous Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_continuous.png" width=50>
	These cards remain on the field once they are activated, and their effect continues while the card stays face-up on the field.

## Equip Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_equip.png" width=50>
	These cards give an extra effect to 1 face-up monster of your choice (either your own or your opponent's, depending on the card). They remain on the field after they are activated. The Equip Spell Card affects only 1 monster (called the equipped monster), but still occupies one of your Spell & Trap Zones. If the equipped monster is destroyed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field, its Equip Cards are destroyed.

## Field Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_field.png" width=50>
	These cards go in your Field Zone and stay there. Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard. These cards may be placed facedown in the Field Zone, but are not active until flipped face-up.

## Quick-Play Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_quick.png" width=50>
	These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your opponent's turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot activate the card in the same turn you Set it.
	<br clear="left">

# Trap cards

Trap Cards will help you out with different effects, just like Spell Cards. The big difference between them is that you can activate Trap Cards during your opponent's turn. Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you can activate it at any time after that-starting from the beginning of the next turn.

Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the field like Trap Cards. However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent's turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase. You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the field to bluff your opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.

## Normal Trap Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_normal.png" width=50>
	These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your opponent's turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot activate the card in the same turn you Set it.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Continuous Trap Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_continuous.png" width=50>
	Just like Continuous Spell Cards, Continuous Trap Cards remain on the field once they are activated and their effects continue while they are face-up on the field. Some Continuous Trap Cards have abilities similar to the Ignition Effects or Trigger Effects that can be found on Effect Monster Cards.

## Counter Trap Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_counter.png" width=50>
	These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require a cost to activate them.

# Other game elements

## Monster Tokens

Monster Tokens are monsters that appear on the field as the result of a card's effect.
- They are not included in the Deck, and cannot be sent anywhere other than the field, such as the hand or Graveyard.
- When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are simply removed from the field instead.
- Each Monster Token takes up 1 of your 5 Monster Zones.
- Their battle position is always either face-up Attack Position or faceup Defense Position.
- Tokens cannot be used as an Xyz Material.
- Tokens on the field are treated as Normal Monsters.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Banishing a token is a conjunction success

If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Counters

You may need to place these on cards for some card effects.
- You cannot place counters unless a card effect allows it.
- Cards may have effects that change with the number of counters on them, or require you to remove counters as a cost.
- Some counters have specific names, such as "Spell Counter" or "Clock Counter." Other than their names, each individual counter itself does not have any effects.

# General Game Mechanics

## Forbidden & Limited Cards

Normally, your Deck (including Extra Deck and Side Deck) can contain up to 3 copies of a card that has the same name. However, certain cards have specific quantity restrictions that further limit the number that can be included in a Deck. There are 3 types of restrictions:
- Limited cards are restricted to 1 copy in a Deck
- Semi-Limited cards are restricted to 2 copies in a Deck
- Forbidden cards are not allowed to be included at all

The list of Forbidden and Limited cards is updated regularly and is posted on the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Official Website. This list is applied to official tournaments so please check it before participating. Official Website: www.yugioh-card.com

## Public Knowledge

The number of cards in a player's hand and Decks, the cards in their Graveyards, and each player's current LP are all public knowledge and both players can verify these things at any time. **If asked, you must answer these things to your opponent truthfully**.

- You are allowed to pick up and verify the cards in your opponent's Graveyard but you must ask their permission first.
- You may not change the order of the cards when verifying their Graveyard.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Rules vs. Card Effects

If there is a discrepancy between the basic rules and a card's effect, the card effect takes precedence. For example, a monster can only attack once per turn, but with a card effect, it is possible to attack twice.

# Duel and Turn Structure

A single game is called a Duel, and a Duel ends when one player wins or the game ends in a draw. Duels are played in sets of 3 called a Match, and the winner of best 2-out-of-3 wins the Match.

## Winning a Duel
Each player starts a Duel with 8000 LP (Life Points). You win a Duel if:
- You reduce your opponent's LP to 0
- If your opponent is unable to draw a card.\
  Even if an effect that makes the player add cards from the Deck to the hand, or send cards from the Deck to the Graveyard, or something similar is activated when there are no cards left in the Deck, this only causes the effect to become unable to resolve but the player is not defeated<sup><a href="#deckout_add_send_from_deck">[2]</a></sup>
- If a card's special effect says you win (alternate victory conditions)

If you and your opponent both reach 0 LP at the same time, or if both players resolve a single effect that makes them draw when neither player has cards in the Deck<sup><a href="#deckout_add_send_from_deck">[2]</a></sup>, the Duel is declared a draw.

A Duel progresses in a series of turns which are divided into phases

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Victory conditions and immediately-afters

Alternate victory conditions are checked and met before a new chain starts, even if a mandatory trigger effect has to start a chain.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Draw Phase

This is the first phase. The player whose turn it is (the "turn player")
- **Must draw 1 card** from the top of their Deck (**except for the very
1st turn of the Duel**). A player with no cards left in their Deck and unable to draw loses the Duel.
- **Can**, after the draw, **activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards** before proceeding to the Standby Phase.

**IMPORTANT**: The player who goes first cannot draw during the Draw Phase of their first turn.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Standby Phase

Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the Standby Phase. The turn player:
- **Can activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards** before proceeding to the Main Phase 1.

*References*:
	<ol>

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Main Phase 1

This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon, Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card's effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in any order you want, but some actions have restrictions. The turn player:
- **Can Summon or Set a monster**. There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn.
- **Can change their Monster's Battle Position**. This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You can change the position of each monster you control, except in three cases:
  1. You cannot change the battle position of a monster that was played onto the field this turn.
  2. You cannot change it in Main Phase 2 if the monster attacked during the Battle Phase.
  3. You cannot change it if you have already changed its battle position once this turn.
- **Can Activate a Card or Effect**. You can activate Spell and Trap Cards, or the effects of Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster Cards as many times as you want during this phase, as long as you can keep paying any costs involved. 
- **Can Set Spell and Trap Cards**. You can Set Spell and Trap Cards face-down in your Spell & Trap Zone during this phase, as long as you have space.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## Battle Phase

Now it's time to battle with your Monster Cards! This phase is divided into steps. You do not have to conduct a Battle Phase every turn, even if you have a monster on the field.

**IMPORTANT**: The player who goes first cannot conduct their Battle Phase on their first turn.

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/bp_steps.png" width=300 />
</div>

The Battle Phase is split into 4 steps and is conducted in the
order shown in the diagram. The Battle Step and Damage Step are repeated each time you attack with a monster.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Start Step

This step starts the Battle Phase. The turn player should announce "I'm entering the Battle Phase." Remember, the player who goes first cannot conduct a Battle Phase in their very first turn.

*References*:
	<ol>

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Battle Step

Select 1 monster on your side of the field to attack with, and 1 of your opponent's monsters as your attack target, and then declare the attack. If your opponent does not have any monsters on the field, you can attack directly. Play then proceeds to the Damage Step. Afterwards, the attacking player returns to the Battle Step, and repeats this procedure.
- Each face-up Attack Position monster you control is allowed 1 attack per turn.
- You do not have to attack with a monster if you don't want to.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Replay Rules during the Battle Step

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/batte_step_replay.png" width=180>
</div>

After you've announced your attacking monster and the attack target monster during a Battle Step, the attack target might be removed from the field, or a new monster may be played onto the opponent's side of the field before the Damage Step, due to a card's effect. This causes a "Replay." When this occurs, you can choose to attack with the same monster again, or choose to attack with a different monster, or choose not to attack at all.

Note that if you attack with a different monster, the first monster is still considered to have declared an attack, and it cannot attack again this turn.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Damage Step

In this step, the players calculate the result of the battle and whatever damage is done. After finishing the Damage Step, return to the Battle Step.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Determining Damage

You calculate battle damage based on the battle position of the monster you are attacking. If you attack an Attack Position monster, compare ATK vs. ATK. If you attack a Defense Position monster, compare your monster's ATK vs. the attacked monster's DEF.

✔️ Spell/Trap Cards and **Quick/Quick-like Effects** that **directly alter the ATK/DEF** of a monster(s), but **only up until damage calculation**. During damage calculation or afterwards in the Damage Step, they cannot be activated<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-3">[3]</a></sup>
	
$\hspace{2em}$✔️ These cards and effects do not have to affect a battling monster; they can be used during the Damage Step to affect the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) that is not currently battling<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-6">[6]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Optional Spell/Trap Cards and Quick/Quick-like Effects that can **indirectly change the ATK/DEF** of a monster (such as "Reverse Trap" or "Skill Drain") **cannot** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-8">[8]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ **Trap Cards that equip themselves to monsters and have Continuous-like Effects that directly alter the ATK/DEF** of the equipped monster, such as "Horn of the Phantom Beast", **can** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-9">[9]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Cards like "Half or Nothing", which **might not alter ATK/DEF at resolution, cannot** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-10">[10]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Cards such as "Powerful Rebirth" and "Reverse of Neos", which Special Summon a monster and exclusively **modify the ATK/DEF of that Summoned** monster, **cannot** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-11">[11]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ If a **Set Continuous Trap Card** has an **optional Quick-like Effect that directly alters the ATK/DEF** of a monster(s) (such as "Attack of the Cornered Rat"), that Trap Card **can** be activated during the Damage Step until damage calculation, but only if that Quick-like Effect is activated and resolved in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-12">[12]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ **Continuous Trap Cards** with **Continuous-like Effects that directly** alter the ATK/DEF of a monster(s), such as "Fire Formation - Kaiyo", **can be activated** during the Damage Step until damage calculation<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-13">[13]</a></sup>

$\hspace{4em}$✔️ Such Trap Cards **can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect would not affect any monsters**, such as activating "Dark Contract with the Witch" during your own turn or while you control no Fiend-Type monsters, or activating "Unpossessed" when a monster other than a "Familiar-Possessed" monster is attacking

$\hspace{4em}$✔️ Such Trap Cards can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect only applies an ATK/DEF change under particular conditions and those conditions are not currently met (such as activating "Chosen of Zefra" while there are fewer than 3 "Zefra" monsters face-up in your Extra Deck), unless that condition could never be met during the Damage Step (such as "Swift Samurai Storm!")<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-14">[14]</a></sup>


$\hspace{4em}$❌ Even if a Continuous Trap Card can be activated during the Damage Step due to having a Continuous-like Effect that alters ATK/DEF, **if it also has a Quick-like Effect that can be activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself** (such as "Dark Contract with the Witch"), **that Quick-like Effect cannot be activated at the same time as the Trap Card's activation during the Damage Step**, unless it has another valid reason allowing it to be activated during the Damage Step<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-15">[15]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Unique exceptions are "Evil Blast"<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-16">[16]</a></sup>, "Scrap Sheen"<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-17">[17]</a></sup> (TCG only), "Zero Force"<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-18">[18]</a></sup>, "Curse of Anubis"<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-19">[19]</a></sup>, and the Quick-like Effect of "Rocket Hand"<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-20">[20]</a></sup>, which have rulings stating that they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Unlike Quick/Quick-like Effects, **having the effect of directly altering the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) does not permit optional Trigger/Trigger-like Effects to be activated during the Damage Step**, with examples being "Morpho Butterspy"<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-21">[21]</a></sup> and "Performapal Turn Toad"

✔️ **Optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects** (if that effect activates in response to the card itself being moved to a different location including leaving the field, being flipped face-up including Flip effects, or having its battle position changed<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-22">[22]</a></sup>) **can be activated during the Damage Step, unless the effect performs a Normal**<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-23">[23]</a></sup> **or Fusion Summon**<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-24">[24]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$❌ In general, other **optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects that have activation conditions that can be met both during and outside the Damage Step cannot be activated**. For cards that have Problem-Solving Card Text, these normally state "(except during the Damage Step)" (for exampl "Fallen of Albaz") in their activation conditions. Otherwise, these effects are associated with activation conditions that involve actions regarding other cards, such as "When/If a ... is destroyed", "When/If a ... is added from ... to your hand", "When/If a ... monster is Special Summoned", etc. of cards like "Revival Rose", "Ambulanceroid", and "Cyber Dinosaur". This includes Trigger Effects of monsters that can activate in response to actions involving itself and/or other cards (but not just itself or other cards), such as "Madolche Chickolates"; they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.

✔️ Any effect that **specifically mentions an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step**

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ This is indicated by phrases in the text such as **"During damage calculation", "At the end of the Damage Step", "If/When you take battle damage", etc.** (this includes cards and effects that activate **in response to damage, without specifying battle damage**, like "Blackfeather Darkrage Dragon", "Attack and Receive", and "Numinous Healer")

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ If a **Set Continuous Trap Card has an optional Trigger-like or optional Quick-like Effect with an activation timing at least partially specific to the Damage Step** (such as "Yang Zing Creation" and "Damage = Reptile"), that Trap Card **can** be activated during the Damage Step if that Trigger-like/Quick-like Effect is also activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-25">[25]</a></sup>

$\hspace{2em}$❌ In contrast, if a **Set Continuous Trap Card has a mandatory Trigger-like Effect with an activation timing at least partially specific to the Damage Step**, the Trap Card itself **cannot** be activated, even if its controller intended on activating that Trigger-like Effect in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-26">[26]</a></sup>

A card only needs to meet one of the above requirements to be activated during the Damage Step. As long as it does not explicitly specify (except during the Damage Step), even if it fails to satisfy one of the above requirements, if it satisfies another one it can be activated during the Damage Step. For example, "Rope of Life" Special Summons a monster and exclusively changes the ATK of the Summoned monster (like "Reverse of Neos"); cards with such effects cannot be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone, but since "Rope of Life" also has an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step ("When a monster(s) is destroyed by battle and sent to your Graveyard:"), it can be activated during the Damage Step.

#### End of the Damage Step still occurs even if damage calculation was never conducted

A card whose effect reads "at the end of the Damage Step" can be activated even if damage calculation has not been conducted and Before Damage Calculation has been reached.

#### Precise sequence of events when substituting for destruction by battle

A card whose effect reads "if (1) you control would be destroyed by battle, you can do (2)" can be applied when performing damage calculation:
- If you choose to apply the effect, immediately after damage calculation do (2), which can be banishing a card, detach a material for effect...
- If you choose not to apply the effect, you can now use any effects that can be activated after damage calculation.

### End Step

After you've resolved all your battles by repeating the Battle and Damage Steps, and you have no more monsters you want to attack with, announce to your opponent that you are ending your Battle Phase.

## Main Phase 2

**If you conducted your Battle Phase**, your turn moves to Main Phase 2 afterwards. The actions a player can perform in this phase are the same as in Main Phase 1. However, if the player already did something in Main Phase 1 that has a limit to the number of times it can be done, the player cannot do it again in Main Phase 2.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

## End Phase

Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the field which say "...during the End Phase..." in their text, resolve those effects in this phase. If you have more than 6 cards in your hand at the end of this phase, select and discard cards to the Graveyard until you only have 6 cards in your hand.

### Mandatory actions during the End Phase

If 2 or more cards effects have mandatory actions during the End Phase ("during the End Phase [...]"), either they start or not a chain, the turn player can choose in which order activate or conduct the actions.

# Activation

To activate is to use a card or effect in a way that makes a Chain Link.
- **Activating a card**: when the card is placed face-up on the field
- **Activating an effect**: when the effect of a card that is already face-up is activated

**References**:

## Chains

Chains are a way to order the resolution of multiple card effects. They are used when the effects of more than 1 card are activated at once, or when a player wants to use an effect after a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the game.

If a card's effect is activated, the opponent is always given a chance to respond with a card effect of their own, creating a Chain. If your opponent responds with an effect, then you can choose to respond and add another effect to the Chain. If your opponent does not respond, you may activate a second effect and create a Chain to your own card's activation. Both players continue to add effects to the Chain until they both wish to add nothing else, then you resolve the outcome in reverse order - starting with the last card that was activated.
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/chain_diagram.png" width=250>
</div>
As shown in the diagram, the first effect activated is Chain Link 1. The next effect is Chain Link 2, and so on. Every time a new Chain Link is made, they are stacked up in the order that the cards are activated. Once the Chain is completed, the outcome is resolved starting with the most recent card to be activated at the top of the Chain and proceeding down to Chain Link 1.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Spell Speed

Every type of card effect has a Spell Speed between 1 and 3. If you want to respond to a card effect in a Chain, you have to use an effect with Spell Speed 2 or higher, and it cannot have a lower Spell Speed than the effect you are responding to.

Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster effects have different Spell Speeds. There are Spell Speeds from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it.

### Actions which cannot be Chained to

You can only create a Chain by responding to the activation of a card or effect. Summoning a monster, Tributing, changing a monster's battle position and paying costs are not effect activations and therefore you cannot respond to those actions using a Chain.

## Fast effect timing

Fast effects are card activations and effects with a Spell Speed of 2 or higher, including monster Quick Effects, Quick-Play Spell Cards, and Trap Cards (which includes both activating Trap Cards, and activating the effects of things like Continuous Trap Cards).

Fast effects can be activated by either player - even during their opponent's turn, as long as the conditions are appropriate. When both players want to activate fast effects at the same time, they are placed on a Chain.

Sometimes, it can make a big difference WHO places their fast effect on the Chain first: this can determine who "goes next".
- Usually, the turn player has the chance to "go next" and activate the next fast effect.
- However, during a Chain, the chance to go next passes back and forth between players.
- Also, if the turn player doesn't wish to take any actions, and instead wants to move along in the turn (for example, to the next Step or Phase), the opponent has an opportunity to go next, and activate a fast effect, before the turn proceeds.

Follow the <a href="#fast_effect_timing_flowchart">chart</a> to see which player can "go next" regarding fast effects.

### Game state and Turn Player Actions

Each Phase and Step starts with the turn player in box A of the chart listed below. This is when the game state is **"open"**, meaning the turn player has complete freedom of action.

Many actions can ONLY be performed when the game state is open (when you're in box A). Examples:
- Normal Summon (including Tribute Summon)
- Set a card
- Perform a Special Summon that does not start a Chain (including Xyz Summon, Synchro Summon)
- Change a monster's Battle Position
- Attempt to move to the next Phase/Step
- Draw a card for your normal draw during the Draw Phase
- Declare an attack
- Activate an Ignition Effect
- Activate a Spell Speed 1 Spell Card

If the game state is "open", the turn player may perform any of the above actions that is appropriate. They can also choose to activate a fast effect, if they wish.

Whenever either player performs an action, the game state is no longer open, but **"closed"**. If the game state is "closed", then only fast effects can be activated, dependent on Fast Effect Timing rules.

When nothing is going on, and neither player wishes to do anything, the game state goes back to being "open". Technically, this means:
- IF the Turn Player has the chance to activate the next fast effect
- AND the turn player passes to the opponent
- AND the opponent then passes back
- AND no Chain is currently being formed

then the game state is open again.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Moving to the Next Phase or Step
If the game state is open, and the turn player chooses not to do anything, and the opponent waives the chance to activate a fast effect, and both players agree to have the turn proceed, then you move to the next Phase or Step.

### Turn Player's Priority

The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either:
- Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect
- Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect.

A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you're passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of play, announcing the end of your phases or steps implies giving up Priority. Therefore, when announcing the end of a phase, your opponent can just say "Before the end of your phase, I activate this card" and use a card. 
- The turn player starts with Priority to activate a card or effect first
- After a card's activation, and at the end of each phase or step, Priority passes to the opponent.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Simultaneous Effects

#### Perform actions simultaneously

For cases like "Each player targets 1 monster," where both players resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect first. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the other player makes theirs.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain (SEGOC)

If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player's mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1.

If there are 2 or more effects:
- The turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order.
- Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order.
- Afterwards, the turn player adds their optional effects in any order.
- And finally the opponent adds their optional effects in any order.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### If ... You Can vs When ... You Can

There is a difference between optional effects that can be used "If" something happens and optional effects you can use "When" something happens.
- Cards that say you can do something **"When"** something happens must activate their effects immediately when that something occurs. If they cannot, or something happens between the time the condition is met and the next time cards or effects can be activated, then you miss your chance to use them.
- Cards that say you can do something **"If"** something happens must activate their effects at the first possible opportunity to activate cards or effects after the "If" condition is met.

Remember, this is only for **optional effects**. Effects that are mandatory, like "The White Stone of Legend", will always activate even though they say "When".

# Card text

## Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)

Problem-Solving Card Text (often abbreviated PSCT) is a method of writing card text used for prints released from July 8, 2011 onward. The purpose of Problem-Solving Card Text is to specify card effects to the point that most situations can be resolved by logically interpreting the card text<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-1">[1]</a></sup>.

Problem-Solving Card Text uses specific words with very particular meanings in the context of gameplay. How to interpret the text is important to understanding how to apply card text to the game.

This interpretation can only be applied for cards that use Problem-Solving Card Text. Cards that were printed with earlier text may use some of the same terms or structures, but this does not necessarily mean that they work as if they were Problem-Solving Card Text.

- All card effects that make a Chain Link include a colon ":" or a semicolon ";" somewhere in their text (possibly both). If a card effect does not use either, it does not make a Chain Link<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup>.
  - The activation of a Spell or Trap Card always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that resolves with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup>. This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card's text.
- Text before the **colon** ":" describes **activation conditions** (limits on when or how often a card or effect can be activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup>). These conditions only need to be met when the card is activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup>.
  - Conditions other than target requirements that have to be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a separate sentence after the effect sentence (e.g. "Zombie Master", "Treeborn Frog")<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup>.
- Text before the **semicolon** ";" (but after the colon, if any) describes anything that happens when that card or effect is activated (such as **costs and targeting**<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup>).
- Built-In Special Summons (other than Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link) are denoted by parentheses "()" stating the location from which the monster can be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-5">[5]</a></sup>.
- Cards with bulleted effects (●) that resolve in the same Chain Link specify whether they resolve simultaneously or sequentially (if sequentially, effects are applied in the order they are listed). In these cases, each effect activated resolves independent of the success of the other(s).
  - The text "in sequence" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied sequentially (e.g. "Gravekeeper's Oracle", "Advance Zone").
  - The text "(simultaneously)" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied simultaneously (e.g. "Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter", "Kunai with Chain").
  - If neither is specified, the effects each make separate Chain Links (e.g. "Metaphys Horus").

### Activation condition/requirement

An activation condition, also known as its activation requirement, is the set of conditions that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.
- Unless otherwise specified, the activation conditions only need to be satisfied when the card is activated, not when it resolves.
- On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the activation condition is written before a colon ":", at the start of a card effect.

**References**:
	<ol>
        <li>		
			<a target="_blank" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Activation_condition">Yugipedia</a>
		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Cost

A cost is an action that must be performed in order to activate a card or effect, to perform another action, or to keep a card on the field. This is distinct from activation requirements, which are requirements that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.
- Costs usually involve the player making a sacrifice of some type, such as paying Life Points (e.g. "Seven Tools of the Bandit" requires the player to pay 1000 Life Points), discarding, Tributing, banishing, detaching a card(s) or sending a card(s) to the Graveyard
- If a cost cannot be fully paid, none of the cost can be paid and the effect cannot be activated.
- A cost is not an effect. If a card is moved to a different location due to a cost, cards and effects that can only be activated when the card is moved by a card effect cannot be activated. For example, the effect of "Shaddoll Dragon" cannot be activated if it is sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate "Phoenix Wing Wind Blast".
- Even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by "Skill Drain"), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost).
- On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the cost is written before a semicolon ";", at the start of a card effect or after the activation condition.

**References**:
	<ol>
        <li>		
			<a target="_blank" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cost">Yugipedia</a>
		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Maintenance cost

A maintenance cost is a cost required to keep a card on the field. They are typically paid during a player's Standby Phase or End Phase. If a player does not, or cannot, pay the maintenance cost of a card, then it will destroy itself (with the exception of "Gaia Plate the Earth Giant" and "Aerial Recharge", which simply send themselves to the Graveyard).
- Maintenance costs are not effects, so they cannot be negated and do not activate or start a Chain Link; even if a card like "Skill Drain" or "Jinzo" is on the field and negating the card's effects, its maintenance cost still needs to be paid.
- Cards such as "Card Guard" and "Field Barrier" cannot protect these cards from destroying themselves due to not paying their maintenance cost, since it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect.

For **mandatory** maintenance costs (such as "Imperial Order", "Degenerate Circuit", "Destructive Draw", "Mind Protector", "Red Screen", "Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"), the player does not have the option of choosing not to pay the cost and letting the card be destroyed. 
- If a mandatory maintenance cost requires LP and the player has exactly the specified amount left, since they must pay, they lose the Duel when the cost comes up due to reaching 0 LP (e.g. when the controller of "Imperial Order" happens to have 700 LP during the Standby Phase).

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Target

Targeting is the action of designating which specific cards are affected or used by card effects at the activation of a card effect.
- Cards can be targeted if they are on the field, in the Graveyard, or banished. Cards in the hand, Main Deck, Extra Deck<sup><a href="#target_pendulum">[1]</a></sup>, or attached as Xyz Material cannot be targeted.
- In Problem-Solving Card Text, cards and effects that target always explicitly state that they target: a card targets if and only if it uses the word "target".
- If a card or effect targets, its targets must be chosen when it is activated.
- You cannot choose to use a card or effect that targets unless there is a card for it to target.
- Equip Spell Cards always target, but activating an effect that equips does not implicitly target<sup><a href="#target_equip">[2]</a></sup>.

If a card was targeted by a card or effect, but when the effect resolves that target has changed location, the target is no longer valid and cannot be affected as the target<sup><a href="#target_dodge">[3]</a></sup>. The player does not get to change their target or select another target at resolution.

#### Cannot "create" target through cost
In order to activate a card (1) with a cost to pay and targets another card (2) for its effect (for example target (2) and Summon it from the Graveyard), a correct target (2) must be present (on the field, in the Graveyard, ...) before attempting (1)'s activation. Even if a valid target would be created after paying (1)'s cost, (1) cannot be activated.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### that target vs it
The terms "that target" or "those targets" and "it" or "they/them" have specific meanings in the resolution of the effect.
- "That target" and "those targets" indicate that targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution to be affected. "Both (those) targets" and "all three targets" indicate that **all** targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution for any of them to be affected.
- "It" and "they/them" indicate that the targets do not need to meet the target requirements at resolution, only when targeted.

### Conjunctives

The conjunctives "and", "and if you do", "also", and "then" have specific meanings<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup>:
- In "Do A, **then** do B", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup>.
- In "Do A **and** B", both A and B happen simultaneously. BOTH A and B are required. If you cannot do both, you do nothing<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup>.
- In "Do A, **and if you do**, do B", both A and B happen simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup>.
- In "Do A, **also** do B", both A and B happen simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup>.
- In "Do A, **also, after that**, do B", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur (This conjunctive was never discussed in the Problem-Solving Card Text articles, as it was not introduced until 2014).

There is no conjunctive that indicates both parts of the effect are required while also indicating that the parts are not simultaneous. While this relationship is rare, it does occur for some effects—in particular, Fusion Summoning and Ritual Summoning effects, which normally text structures unique to that Summoning method, which do not use conjunctives at all for that part of their text. The card "Luminous Dragon Ritual" uniquely indicates this relationship with the conjunctive "and" followed by "after that" at the end of the second part of the effect.

<div align="center">

| | Neither required | A required | Both required |

| **Sequentially**   | also, after that  | then | |
| **Simultaneously** | also  			 | and if you do | and |

#### Banishing a token is a conjunction success

If a Token's (1) properties (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF and/or Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).

#### 0 ATK/DEF, reduction, and conjunction success

A card's (1) effect which lowers a stat of a monster with action A and then does an action B, if action A applies to a monster (2) whose stat is lower than 1000 (even 0), then B **will** apply (even if (2)'s ATK is already 0, B will apply even if A is required such as "if you do" conjunctive).

## Glossary: Terms and Phrases

### Activate vs Use

- Cards that state "You can only activate this card once per turn/Duel" can be activated again in the same turn/Duel if their activation is negated.
  - For example: "Silver's Cry" (which can only be activated once per turn) and "The Seal of Orichalcos" (which can only be activated once per Duel) can be activated again during the same turn or Duel if another copy had its activation negated (such as by "Magic Jammer"), but not if only its effect was negated (such as by "Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy").
- Effects that state "You can only use this effect once per turn/Duel" cannot be activated again in the same turn/Duel, even if their activation is negated.
  - For example: "Souleating Oviraptor" can only use each of its effects once per turn, while "Dotscaper" can only use each of its effects once per Duel, even if these monsters' effects are negated by a card such as "Solemn Strike".

### Attach

#### Attaching material affects the monster

If an effect (1) that involves attaching a card (2) as an Xyz Material to a Xyz Monster on the field (3) is activated, if (3) is unaffected by cards' effects, then (1) resolves without attaching (2) to (3).

### Attack all once each

#### Attack target redirection
If a monster (1) can attack all opponent's monsters once each, if it attacks a monster (2) but then its attack is redirected to another monster (3), (1) cannot attack again (2). Furthermore, (3) which has been made the attack target instead of (2), if (3) has not been destroyed by battle after the attack redirection, (1) cannot attack again (3).

### Banish instead of sending to the Graveyard

#### Banish only monsters and paying cost
When the effect "any Monster sent to the GY is banished instead" is applying you:

- **Cannot** activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster to the Graveyard as a cost.
- **Cannot** activate a card or effect that send cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard as cost as there may be monster cards among them<sup><a href="#banish_only_monsters_and_paying_cost-1">[1]</a></sup>.
- **Can** activate a card or effect that requires you to send a Monster Card not treated as a Monster (for example treated as an Equip Spell Card) to the Graveyard as a cost<sup><a href="#banish_only_monsters_and_paying_cost-2">[2]</a></sup>.

#### Banish vs cannot banish

If the two effects "any card sent to the GY is banished instead" and "neither player can banish cards" are applying both simultaneously, cards sent to the Graveyard will not be banished and are sent to the Graveyard normally.

### Battle/Battled

A monster "battles" (and is "battling") starting from when it attacks or is attacked. This includes both monsters attacking other monsters, and monsters attacking a player's Life Points directly.

When a card requires a monster to have "battled" (past tense), the attack had to have reached the damage calculation portion of the Damage Step in order for the monster to have "battled". If the attack stops before damage calculation, the monster did not "battle". (Note that **an attack was still declared**, however, so in most cases the attacking monster cannot declare another attack).

### Can only control 1

Taking as examples "Rivalry of Warlords" and "Gozen Match", these are Continuous Trap Cards that make it so you can only control face-up monsters of 1 Type (for Rivalry) or 1 Attribute (for Gozen).

When this Trap Card's activation resolves, look at the face-up monsters you control. If they all have the same Type/Attribute, you don't have to do anything else. If there are different Types/Attributes, you choose 1 Type/Attribute to keep, and send your face-up monsters that aren't that Type/Attribute to the Graveyard.

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Destruction not by card effect

Monsters which violate this kind of effects are sent to the graveyard and are not considered as destroyed by card effects.

*References*:
	<ol>
		<li>
			YGOrg Database of Official OCG Rulings: <a target="_blank" href="https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#8632">"Gravekeeper's Chief", "Archfiend Zombie-Skull"</a>
		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### What monsters can be summoned

While Rivalry/Gozen is active and you have a face-up monster, you cannot Summon monsters that are a different Type/Attribute from the monster(s) you already control.

So you can't do any of the following to put a monster with the wrong Type/Attribute on your side of the field:
- Normal Summon
- Tribute Summon
- Flip Summon
- Xyz Summon
- Synchro Summon
- Fusion Summon
- Special Summon with a monster's own effect.
- Activate a card or effect that would have to Special Summon a monster of the wrong Type/Attribute (including effects that could theoretically Summon anything, but currently cannot, such as "Monster Reborn" when you control Spellcasters but the only monsters in the Graveyard are Zombies).

While Rivalry/Gozen is active, you can still Set monsters of any Type/Attribute, and you can Special Summon monsters of the wrong Type/Attribute face-down. But you can't Flip Summon them afterwards, and they're sent to the Graveyard after damage calculation if your opponent attacks them. (Also, in that case, you won't get the effects of cards that need to be destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, because they're sent to the Graveyard by the Trap Card's effect instead. But Flip Effects will still activate).

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Special Summoning cards and effects that can be activated
- You can activate cards and effects that would Summon the same Type/Attribute monster as you have on the field.
- You can also activate cards that would Summon more than one Type/Attribute of monster. The results depend on what you have on the field:
  - If you DON'T control any monsters: You can activate cards that would Summon monsters with more than one Type/Attribute. All of them are Summoned, but you must immediately pick one Type/Attribute and send all others to the Graveyard.
  - If you already DO control a monster: First of all, if the Summoning effect targets, you can only target monsters with the right Type/Attribute. If the Summoning effect does NOT target, you can activate it as long as it is possible to resolve the effect using only monsters with the right Type/Attribute. In this case, only the right monsters are Summoned to the field.

The same rule applies to the "Gladiator Beast" monsters and similar effects. You can return a Gladiator Beast to your Deck and activate its effect as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck that you COULD Summon that is the same Type/Attribute as the one you returned. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon any Type/Attribute of monster.

	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Taking control

You can take control of an opponent's monster that's the wrong Type/Attribute with a card like "Mind Control". If you do, it's sent to the Graveyard immediately after you gain control of it.

### Control/Possess

- Cards you "control" are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell & Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone.
- Cards in your "possession" include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the field, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control.

If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller's side of the field. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Destroy

A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered "destroyed." always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Discard

Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Equip to

In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster.
- Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards
- Equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells.

The term "Equip Card" includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters).

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Equipped Monster

A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an "equipped monster." When this monster is destroyed or flipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.

*References*:
	<ol>

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Move equipped Monster Card to another target

If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so.

**EXCEPTION**: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Excavate

When a card says to "excavate" cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Leaves the field

Some monsters have effects that activate when they "leave the field". For example, these effects activate when the monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck.

When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Name treated as ...

- If cards with an effect that say "This card's name is **always** treated as [...]" are included in the Deck, the card is treated as having that card name, for example: since "Cyber Harpie Lady" says "(This card's name is always treated as "Harpie Lady".)", you can only include up to 3 copies in total of "Harpie Lady" and "Cyber Harpie Lady" in your Main Deck.
- Up to 3 copies of cards that are treated as having a different name by an effect can be included separately from cards with the name that is provided by that effect, for example: you can include 3 copies of each "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and "Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon" which has an effect that says "This card's name **becomes** "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" while it is on the **field or in the Graveyard**."

### Piercing Battle Damage

Some monsters can inflict piercing battle damage when they attack a Defense Position monster. This means that you inflict damage to your opponent's LP equal to the difference between the attacking monster's ATK and the defending monster's DEF.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Random

When a card effect says to choose a card randomly, there is no official way of doing so, it is fine as long as neither player has a way of knowing which card is being chosen.

*References*:
	<ol>

		</li>
	</ol>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Reveal

When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card or its Flip effect. Normally, revealed cards are returned to their original position after being looked at by both players.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Send to the Graveyard

A card can be sent to the Graveyard in various ways. Destroying a card, discarding, and Tributing a monster are all actions that send a card to the Graveyard, and will normally activate "When/If this card is sent to the
Graveyard..." Trigger Effects.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

#### Return to the Graveyard

When a banished card is moved to the Graveyard, it is not considered to be "sent to the Graveyard".

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to table of contents</a>)</p>

### Summon from Spell/Trap Zone (and vice versa)

If an effect (1) targets a Monster Card (2) in the Spell/Trap Zone ((1) is not treated as a monster), if another card is chained to (1) and summons (2) to the Monster Zone, then (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) resolves without effect<sup><a href="#summon_from_spell_trap_zone-1">[1]</a></sup>.\
Similary, if (1) targets (2) while in a Monster Zone but (2) is placed in the Spell/Trap Zone, (2) is no longer treated as the same card that was targeted by (1), so (1) resolves without effect<sup><a href="#summon_from_spell_trap_zone-2">[2]</a></sup>.

### Tribute

Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or activating an effect. A monster sent to the Graveyard by Tributing is not treated as "destroyed."

### Unaffected

#### Attaching material affects the monster

If an effect (1) that involves attaching a card (2) as an Xyz Material to a Xyz Monster on the field (3) is activated, if (3) is unaffected by cards' effects, then (1) resolves without attaching (2) to (3), and (1) is sent to the Graveyard.

## Effects Interaction

### Activation legality

#### Targeting, location and cost
In order to activate a card (1) with a cost to pay and targets another card (2) for its effect (for example target (2) and Summon it from the Graveyard), a correct target (2) must be present (on the field, in the Graveyard, ...) before attempting (1)'s activation. Even if a valid target would be created after paying (1)'s cost, (1) cannot be activated.

#### Add, discard and send
A card's (1) effect which involves adding a card (2) with a certain property and then discarding/sending a card (3) with (2)'s same property, (1) can be activated even if there are no cards of with (2)'s property in your hand at the moment of (1)'s activation.

### Change of control shenanigans with lack of space

If your monster Zones are full you:

- **Cannot** activate optional effects that would take control of an opponent's monster
- **Can** activate mandatory effects that would take control of an opponent's monster

Also you **can** activate optional effects that would take control of more than one opponent's monsters when you have at least one free Monster Zone, even if the number of monsters you would take control at resolution exceed the number of your free Monster Zones

After a successful activation of such card, if you do not have enough room in your Monster Zones, the extras are destroyed.

### Location changes mid-chain

If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location* changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate. [*On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck.]

### Retaining information

#### Monsters with multiple attributes count for all their attributes when used as material.

A monster (1) who gains different effects based on the materials used for its Summon, if one (2) of the materials had an effect on the field that treated its attribute as multiple attributes, then (1) will gain all the respective effects based on the multiple attributes of (2).

### Stats (ATK/DEF) modifiers

#### Categories and interactions

Any given modifier can fall under one of the following different categories:

1. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

2. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

3. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

4. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

5. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.

6. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.

Possible outcomes:

-  (x) are always applied successfully/Apply (x) after previous (5,6)

- Remove previous (y) when applying (x): apply (x) then when (x) stops applying the value will forget/won't apply anymore about (y)

- (y) are not reapplied until (x) stops applying

- Apply (x) and reapply (y) afterwards

- Apply new (x): overwrites previous (y) of the same kind, if (x) stops applying then (y) will return to apply

In the examples, the two cards on the left are the "Prev", the card on the right separated by the previous two is the "New": "→" signifies the value after the "New" effect is applied, "⇒" signifies the value after the "New" effect has stopped applying

#### Special cases

For these special cases, no matter what the effects currently in play are, they are always applied last. If a new effect is applied, reapply
those effects right afterwards.\
When those effects stop applying, reapply everything, including lingering effects (1,3,5)

#### Gain original/printed stat of tributes

A monster (1) whose effect reads "The ATK of this card becomes the combined original ATK of the Tributed monsters", if it is Summoned by tributing a monster (2) on the field whose **original** ATK was set by another card (3), (1)'s ATK will be (2)'s printed ATK even though (2)'s original ATK differs from its printed ATK due to (3).
