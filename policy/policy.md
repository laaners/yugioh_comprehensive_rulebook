# I. Preparing to Play

## E. Floor Judge

Judges may not wear official KDE-E Judge Program judge shirts when they are not judging an event.
- Judges should **avoid** socializing with Duelists or other judges during a tournament.
- Judges should **not** engage in trading, long personal conversations, phone calls or other activities that would distract them from the tournament.
- Judges **should** constantly observe the tournament, and maintain the tournament area by removing trash, pushing in chairs, and straightening tables.
- Judges **should** actively walk the tournament floor and observe the matches, rather than waiting for a Duelist to call for a judge.
- Judges are **required** to step in if they observe any violation of the rules or game play - judges **do not need to wait** for Duelists to call for assistance.
- Judges should be careful **not** to "coach" a Duelist or reveal information on Private Knowledge when responding to questions.
- Judges **should** answer questions about cards in the Duelist's hand or on the field, regarding:
    - Game mechanics
    - The legality of the activation of an effect
    - Card text
- Judges **should not** answer questions that would:
    - Involve a discussion of cards not in the Duelist's hand or on the field
    - Provide Duelists with specific strategy advice
    - Instruct a Duelist how best to play their cards
    - Reveal Private Knowledge
- Judges should be careful **not to reveal** information about anything considered to be Private Knowledge when answering questions.
- Judges **do not need to wait** for the Duelist to attempt an action to answer any of the above questions and should **not** instruct Duelists to attempt an action before answering their question.

When a Duelist calls for a judge, the judge should:
- Approach the table
- Listen carefully to the question
    - If both Duelists try to talk at once, ask for the turn player to speak first. Assure the opponent they will also get a chance to speak.
- Ask for additional information if necessary, seeking confirmation from all Duelists involved
- Make a decision
- Issue the ruling
- Duelists have the right to appeal a ruling or policy decision made by a floor judge. If either Duelist wishes to appeal, the judge should notify the Head Judge immediately.
    - If the initial decision was made by the Head Judge, or an Assistant Head Judge (Tier 3 events), their decision is final and cannot be appealed.

- Judges should stay current with rulings and cards as they are released. Judges are also responsible for knowing policy documents and should keep themselves informed and well-versed in new documents as they are made available.
- Judges should actively seek out additional training and assist fellow judges in doing the same.
- Judges are encouraged to complete certification tests to assess their ability and knowledge.
- Unless they are answering a judge call or examining a current game, judges should refrain from conversing with Duelists engaged in a Match, to avoid distracting them or creating the impression of favoritism. This especially applies to conversations held in a language the opponent doesn't understand.

### Should be answered

- **Pointing out an illegal activation after it happened**\
Duelist A has a face-up **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal** on the field that has its effects currently negated by **Infinite Impermanence**. Duelist B has three or more Spell Cards in their Graveyard.\
\
During Duelist B's Main Phase, Duelist B activates **Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor**, targeting the **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal**.\
\
Duelist A informs Duelist B that he will not be able to take control of his **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal**, as it has already been negated and cannot be negated again. Duelist B calls for a judge.\
\
The judge should inform the Duelists that because **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal** was already negated by another card, it cannot be targeted by **Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor** and it is an illegal activation. The judge should then fix the Game State as necessary.
- **Pointing out an illegal activation before it happens**\
Duelist A has a face-up **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal** on the field that has its effects currently negated by **Infinite Impermanence**. Duelist B has three or more Spell Cards in their Graveyard. During Duelist B's Main Phase, Duelist B calls for a judge. Duelist B shows their hand to the judge and asks if they would be able to take control of **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal** with "this card in their hand" (**Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor**).\
\
Without revealing the Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor to Duelist A, the judge should inform Duelist B that the activation of "that card" would be illegal. This is protecting the Game State and is not coaching.
- **Answering what cards are legal to activate before it happens**\
Duelist A Normal Summons Trickstar Candina and activates its effect with four (4) other cards in his hand. Duelist B has **Infinite Impermanence** and **Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring** in his hand, and no cards on his side of the field.\
\
Duelist B calls a judge and asks, "Which one of these cards can I use?", showing the judge his hand. The judge should inform Duelist B (without revealing the contents of his hand) that either of the two cards are legal to activate at this time.\
\
The judge should not provide additional information until after the Duelist makes the decision to activate a card and it is time to resolve the chain.
- **Explaining card text**\
Duelist A has **Gozen Match** and **Thunder Dragon Titan** on the field and more than two (2) cards in his Graveyard; Duelist B has **Sky Striker Ace - Kagari** on the field, **Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!** in his hand and three (3) or more Spell Cards in his Graveyard.\
\
In Duelist B's Main Phase he calls for a judge. Duelist B shows his hand to the judge and asks, "If I use this on his monster, but it does not get destroyed, can I still destroy 1 Spell/Trap on the field?"\
\
Without revealing the card in question or giving a yes/no answer, the Judge should quickly explain Problem-Solving Card Text conjunctions to the Duelists, and how those conjunctions are used to determine how the effects will resolve.

### Should not be answered
- Duelist A has a face-up **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal** on the field. Duelist B has a set **Infinite Impermanence**, **Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor** in the hand, and three or more Spell Cards in their Graveyard. On Duelist B's turn, Duelist A activates the effect of **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal**.\
\
Duelist B calls for a judge and shows them the cards in question. She asks if she would be able to use **Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor** on **Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal** after **Infinite Impermanence** resolves.\
\
Without informing Duelist A of the cards in question, the judge should inform Duelist B that the question cannot be answered because it could influence her decisions and therefore be considered coaching.
- Duelist A Normal Summons **Trickstar Candina** and activates its effect with four (4) other cards in his hand. Duelist B has **Infinite Impermanence** and **Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring** in his hand, and no cards on his side of the field.\
\
Duelist B calls a judge and asks "Which one of these would stop his **Trickstar Candina** if he has **Trickstar Lycoris**?", showing the judge his hand.\
\
The judge should inform Duelist B that he cannot answer that question, as it would be coaching; and that he cannot answer questions about cards that are not on the field.
- Duelist A has **Gozen Match** and **Ultimate Conductor Tyranno** in her hand.\
\
Duelist B has **Sky Striker Ace - Kagari** on the field, and two (2) copies of **Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!** in his hand.\
\
Duelist B activates Sky **Striker Mobilize - Engage!** and while trying to decide what to search, calls for a judge. Duelist B asks the judge "What will happen if she has **Gozen Match** and I use **Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor**?"\
\
The judge should inform Duelist B that she cannot answer questions about cards that are not on the field or questions that might influence his strategic decisions.

## I. Spectators

It is a spectator's duty to remain neutral while observing game play, and to make sure their presence does not disrupt the event.
- At the discretion of the Head Judge, spectating of a tournament may be limited or restricted.
- Spectators should not speak to or communicate in any way with Duelists who are currently engaged in a match.
- If a spectator notices any violation of game play rules or Tournament Policy, they must alert a tournament official immediately.
- Spectators must be prepared to move if their presence blocks judge access, throughways, fire exits, or any other paths identified by tournament staff.
- Spectators will be asked to move if their presence is distracting to any of the Duelists. If a judge or tournament official instructs a spectator to move, they must comply.

# II. Duelist Responsibility

## D. Tournament Materials

You must bring a tournament legal Deck (to Constructed events), as well as extra card sleeves, paper and pens/pencils to track scores and fill out Match Result slips, and any dice, coins, counters, tokens, etc., that your Deck requires.
- Calculators may not be used to track Life Points.
    - You may use a calculator or the NEURON app to assist with the math involved in adding or subtracting Life Points, but you must keep a paper record of all Life Point changes to help resolve any disputes.
In addition to tournament supplies, you must bring the appropriate cost of registration (if any), a Smart Device with NEURON (with their CARD GAME ID), and personal identification.

You are responsible to ensure that any dice, coins, counters, or tokens you bring to the event meet tournament-legal standards.

## E. Neuron

NEURON has an offline mode, which includes (but is not limited to) a Life Point application, a coin flip and dice roll application, and a Camera Search feature; and an online mode, which includes (but is not limited to) Card Database access, Forbidden and Limited List access, and News and other announcements.

- During a Match, Duelists **must turn off NEURON's sound effects and music**.
- During a Match in a Sanctioned or Official tournament, NEURON may be used in offline mode for the following functions only:
    - Life Point calculation (Duelists must still also keep a paper record of Life Points)
    - Dice rolls/coin flips
    - Camera Search for card translations
    - Offline Card Database searches
- **Online functions, including News or accessing the Forbidden and Limited list, may not be utilized during a Match**

## H. Unacceptable Behavior

- Rude language, disruptive or disrespectful behavior, inappropriate clothing or materials, unwarranted accusations, and/or disregard for the safety of others or the condition of the venue will not be tolerated.
- If you arrive at an event intoxicated or under the influence of any narcotics or controlled substances or become so during the course of the event, you will be Disqualified and removed from the venue and may be subject to additional penalties.
- If you arrive at an event under the influence of any substances prohibited in the FAQ, or become so during the course of the event, you will be Disqualified and removed from the venue and may be subject to additional penalties.
- Prescription medicine may only be brought to/used at the event by the person for whom it is prescribed.
- Persons may not bring any items into the tournament venue that are prohibited by law in their area (local, state, or federal). In addition, unlawful items/transactions, weapons of any kind, and substance drugs (whether or not they are legal on a local, state, National and/or federal level), and anything prohibited in the event FAQ are not allowed at Sanctioned/Official events. People who bring any such items to a tournament venue will incur penalties, including Disqualification and removal from the event, and risk suspension from KDE Organized Play.
- The use of electronic and/or vapor cigarettes is not permitted on the tournament floor at any Sanctioned/Official events, or in areas designated for tournament attendees.
- The following electronic devices may be used during a Match, for the following uses only:
    - Calculators may be used to assist with Life Point calculation, and not as the sole means of tracking Life Points.
    - Smartphones may be used only for the offline functions of NEURON, listed above in section II. E. You may not text, talk, access the internet, look at files on your phone, etc. during a Match.
    - Smart watches or similar items which can send or receive messages must have messaging functions disabled during a Match.
- Other electronic devices are prohibited for use during a Match. Duelists with a medical necessity for an electronic device other than a calculator should speak with the Head Judge prior to the start of the tournament.
- You may not wear headphones or earbuds during a Match.
- You may not eat or drink on tournament tables, including between rounds. You may keep water etc. with you, but containers must have lids and cannot be kept on the table.
- If you attend an event in costume, you may not wear any masks, hoods, etc., that cover your face during the registration process or during any Duel. You are responsible for ensuring that your costume or accessories will not damage tournament property or injure other persons at the event. Face paint or makeup that obscures or hides your face is also prohibited.
- Duelists with a medical or religious necessity for masks or other head/face coverings should speak with the Head Judge prior to the start of the tournament.
- Certain areas may require masks or face coverings to be worn, in the interest of public health. In these circumstances, Duelists should wear appropriate masks or face coverings as required

## I. Communication

It is your responsibility to relay accurate information at all times. Failure to follow any of these rules may result in penalties.

You are required to answer completely and honestly all questions relevant to maintaining an accurate Game State, or regarding matters of Public Knowledge.

You should clearly communicate your actions during game play and ask questions of your opponent or a tournament official if you are unsure about something.

You are obligated to immediately notify your opponent (and a judge, if necessary) if your opponent fails to follow any game rules, including effects they may be playing incorrectly, the moment that you notice the issue.

You should never touch any of your opponent's cards or other items without first asking permission.

You may not retract **legal** moves once you have committed to them. Committing to a move includes, but is not limited to, verbally stating or announcing an action, placing a card on the field, or removing your hand from a card once the physical action has been taken.\
If your verbal statement contradicts a legal play or action you take in the game and the verbal statement is a legal play or action, the verbal statement overrules the action you performed.

### Legal actions cannot be retracted
- **Setting a different Spell/Trap**\
A Duelist sets a card in the Spell/Trap Card Zone and removes his hand from the card. The Duelist may not choose to "take back" the move and re-add the Set card to his hand.
- **Change the monster that attacked**\
A Duelist has two (2) face-up Attack Position monsters on the field. During her Battle Phase, she verbally declares an attack with Monster A, while gesturing that Monster B attacks the opponent directly. If Monster A can legally attack, the Duelist cannot make a different choice.
- **Change searched card**\
A Duelist uses a card effect to search for a card in his Deck. He selects a card and reveals the card to his opponent. He cannot change his mind and search for a different card instead (even if he never took his hand off the card).
- **Change summoned monster**\
A Duelist places **Infernity Sage** on the field in face-up Attack Position. She cannot change her mind and put the monster back in her hand (even if she never took her hand off the card).

### Retracting moves due to illegal Activation
If you take an action in the game that turns out to be illegal, call for a judge. The judge can assess the situation, allow any necessary retractions or corrections, and issue the appropriate penalty.
- **Illegal summon**\
A Duelist declares they will perform a Link Summon of **Knightmare Phoenix**. They send two (2) copies of **Mystical Shine Ball** they control to the Graveyard and Summon **Knightmare Phoenix**. Afterwards, both Duelists realize **Knightmare Phoenix** requires two (2) monsters with different names. A judge should be called, the move will be retracted, and the judge will issue a Procedural Error penalty
- **Illegal target (different intention)**\
A Duelist activates **Monster Reborn** from his hand and targets **Destiny HERO - Plasma** in his Graveyard. Since **Destiny HERO - Plasma** must be Special Summoned through its effect, the activation of **Monster Reborn** is illegal and **Monster Reborn** is returned to his hand, and a judge will issue a Procedural Error penalty. This is true even if he has another monster in his Graveyard that can be Special Summoned with the effect of **Monster Reborn**.
- **Illegal target (different intention)**\
Duelist A has a **Skull Servant** and an **Accesscode Talker** in his Graveyard. He activates **Monster Reborn** from his hand and targets the **Accesscode Talker**. Duelist B has no response and Duelist A Summons the monster. Soon after resolving the effect, Duelist B realizes that he negated the Link Summon of **Accesscode Talker** with **Solemn Warning**. Since the card was an illegal target, the entire activation of **Monster Reborn** was illegal. **Accesscode Talker** should be returned to the Graveyard and the **Monster Reborn** should be returned to Duelist A's hand. Duelist A is not forced to target the **Skull Servant** in his Graveyard.
- **Misunderstanding effect/mechanics (different intention)**\
Duelist A activates the Graveyard effect of **Miscellaneousaurus** to banish itself and Summon a level 1 dinosaur monster. Duelist B attempts to chain his set **Called by the Grave** targeting **Miscellaneousaurus** to banish and negate the effect. However, since **Miscellaneousaurus** banishes itself as cost to activate its effect, it is no longer in the Graveyard when **Called by the Grave** can be chained. **Called by the Grave** should be returned face-down since the target was illegal. Duelist B is not forced to target another monster in Duelist A's Graveyard.
- **Illegal activation**\
Duelist B controls **Necrovalley**. Duelist A attempts to activate the effect of **Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms** in her hand by banishing Wind monsters and/or Dragon monsters from her hand and/or Graveyard. She chooses to banish 2 from her Graveyard but Duelist B informs Duelist A that **Necrovalley** prevents any cards in the Graveyards from being banished. **Dragon Ruler of Storms** should remain in Duelist A's hand as the cost paid was illegal.

</table>

Rules and tournament policy are equally important even at Tier 1 events and should be enforced. In addition to enforcing rules and policy, judges and other tournament officials should take time to educate Duelists about mistakes or infractions, so they learn correct game play.
- Registered KONAMI Judges are not required for Tier 1 events. Registered KONAMI Judges are recommended, to help provide a consistent and enjoyable tournament experience to the participating Duelists.
- Registered KONAMI Judges are required for all Tier 2, 3, and 4 events.

## C. Time Limits

Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG rounds are 45 minutes in length at Tier 1 and Tier 2 events. KDE-E may choose to adjust round lengths at certain Tier 3 or 4 events such as Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series, National and State Championships, etc.\
Any changes made to the tournament round will be announced before the start of the event.

For Single-Elimination playoff rounds, the time limit may be increased at the discretion of the Head Judge, but only if the increase is announced before the start of the Playoff Rounds.

## D. Number of Duels

- Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG matches are run in a best-of-three Duels format.
    - It is possible to play more than three Duels in a Match if Duels end in a Draw before the end of the round.
- The first Duelist to win two Duels is declared the winner of the Match.
- If a Duelist loses two Duels, they are considered to have lost the Match.
    - If both Duelists have one Game Loss in a Match and both receive a simultaneous Game Loss, the Match is considered a Double Loss, which means neither Duelist will receive a Win for the Match.

# IV. Tournament Play

## A. Sportsmanship

- You are expected to behave in a respectful, polite manner towards all tournament attendees; including Duelists, judges, tournament officials, and spectators.
- If you engage in unsporting conduct or behavior that endangers or detracts from the event you may be penalized, up to and including being Disqualified and/or removed from the venue.
- Unsporting conduct can include threatening or harassing behavior online (social media, forums, Discord, and other forms of messaging), whether or not it occurs during a Sanctioned event.
- You should read the Official KDE-E Tournament Infractions and Penalty Policy as well as all event FAQs for a better understanding of acceptable behavior at tournaments.

## D. Deck Registration

Tier 1 Events:
- Most Tier 1 events do not require a Deck List to be submitted.
- TOs may require Deck Lists to be submitted for Tier 1 events, but only if the requirement is announced before the start of the event.

Tier 2 - 4 events:
- Tier 2 to 4 events all require Deck Lists.
- Deck List submission, depending on the event, will use either the official Deck List form, a Deck List tool on an online registration website, or the "Save List" function in NEURON (information found below).
- Read the event FAQ or ask the Tournament Organizer if you are unsure which method(s) will be accepted for your event.

Events offering Online Registration:
- Events with online registration may require Deck Lists to be submitted using an online Deck List system. Check event FAQs or contact the TO with any questions.
- Deck Lists submitted online may be updated and resubmitted before the deadline for Deck List submission.
- You must still meet all Deck List submission deadlines specified for the event.
- You may not submit a new Deck List for any other reason.
- You may not drop from an event and re-register, in an attempt to submit a new Deck List.

Events offering In-Person Registration:
- For any events with in-person registration, a paper copy of the Deck List, either legibly written or printed from a computer, must be submitted in order to register.
- Once a Deck list has been submitted, it may not be altered or changed.
- Once a Deck list has been submitted, a new Deck List cannot be submitted.
- You may not drop from an event and re-register, in an attempt to submit a new Deck List.

## E. Shuffling

Your Deck must be randomized using an accepted shuffling method (riffle, pile, Hindu, etc.) and then cut. This must be done at the start of every Duel, and whenever a game mechanic requires you to shuffle your Deck. Shuffling must be done in a timely manner. You must thoroughly randomize (shuffle) your Deck in view of your opponent.
- You cannot check or arrange any cards while shuffling, without thoroughly shuffling the Deck afterwards.
- You cannot pre-sort your Deck (sorting Monsters/Spell/Trap, etc.) without thoroughly shuffling the Deck afterwards.

After a Deck is thoroughly randomized, it must be presented to the opponent. The opponent must randomize (shuffle) the Deck further and then return it to the original owner.

The owner may then "cut" their own Deck. If they do, they must present it to the opponent who must "cut" the Deck again and then present it back to the original owner. No additional randomization may be done to the Deck after this point.
- By presenting your Deck to your opponent, you agree that you have sufficiently randomized your Deck and that your Deck is legal and matches your Deck List.

After both Decks have been shuffled and presented to the opponent, both Duelists should ensure that all Deck elements are placed in their respective zones.

Both Duelists should count out their Side Decks in view of their opponent, to confirm how many cards are there.

You are not required to keep your Side Deck on the table, it can be returned to the Card Case for safekeeping.

If the Side Deck is kept in the Card Case, the Card Case must be kept on the table in view of both Duelists

## F. Determining Who Goes First

- After both Decks have been shuffled, both Duelists should use a random method to decide who chooses to go first. You may roll a die, play Rock-Paper-Scissors, etc.
- The method must be agreed upon and clearly understood by both Duelists beforehand. If a "high roll" will determine the deciding Duelist, all Duelists should clearly agree that the Duelist who rolls the highest number on the selected die or dice gets to choose whether or not to go first. If a die or coin is used, both Duelists should use the same die or coin.
- When a deciding Duelist has been selected, they will choose who goes first in Duel 1 of the Match. This decision must be made before ANY cards have been drawn, or any Duel play has begun.
- If the deciding Duelist draws cards before stating who will go first, they must automatically go first. Drawing cards before deciding who will go first may result in a penalty.
- During Duel 2 or Duel 3 of the Match, the losing Duelist of the previous Duel will decide who may go first.
- If the outcome of a Duel was determined by a Game Loss penalty, the Duelist assigned the penalty (the losing Duelist) may still determine who will go first for the next Duel.
- In the case of a Duel ending in a Draw, another random method should be employed to choose the deciding Duelist.

## G. Sleeves

You may choose to use plastic card sleeves to protect your cards during the course of a tournament. Sleeves are required at Tier 2 and higher events.
- All sleeves in the Main and Side Decks must be identical in terms of color, wear, and design.
- You may choose to put your Extra Deck in sleeves that are different from your Main and Side Decks. All other sleeve rules still apply to the Extra Deck.
- All cards must be placed into sleeves in the same direction and manner.
- You may have only one card in each sleeve. You may not have anything but that card in the sleeve.
- Sleeves with mirror-like highly reflective backs are not allowed.
- Sleeves with holographic fronts are not allowed.
- Sleeves with designs or artwork on the front that obscure card text or illustrations are not allowed.
- Sleeves with artwork on the backs, provided that all sleeves are identical and of non-offensive nature, are allowed. Sleeves with graphics or text be used. The Head Judge will decide whether or not artwork on the back of sleeves is offensive.
- Sleeves that are large enough to allow your cards to shift inside the sleeves cannot be used.
- Top loaders or other hard cases cannot be used as card sleeves.

You may choose to use a second sleeve (double sleeving) on each of your cards, providing you abide by the following additional rules:
- One of the additional sleeves must be clear on both sides. The clear sleeve may have a brand, watermark, or artwork so long as it does not interfere with the readability of the card.
    - It does not matter which of the sleeves (outer or inner) is clear on both sides.
    - Clear sleeves with a tint are allowed only if they do not interfere with the readability of the front of a card. Check with the Head Judge of your event to determine whether your usage of these types of clear sleeves is acceptable.
- The additional clear sleeve may not have a holographic pattern on the front of the sleeve.
- The additional clear sleeve must be placed onto the card opposite to the regular sleeve, so the card is "sealed" inside of the two sleeves.
- You may only have one card in each pair of sleeves.
- You may only have up to two sleeves on each card.

Sleeves with excessive wear, noticeable patterns, factory defects, or other identifying characteristics will be considered marked, and will be disallowed by the Head Judge.
- You may also be subject to penalties, regardless of the tournament Tier, if your sleeves are determined to be marked. If you have a question about the legality of your sleeves, the Head Judge is the final arbiter as to whether or not your sleeves can be used in that tournament. If you are unsure if your sleeves are marked, you should consult a judge prior to the start of the tournament or as soon as the possible markings are discovered.
- Even if the judge does not determine the sleeves to be marked, sleeves could still become marked during the event. You are responsible to keep track of the wear and tear on your sleeves and replace them as needed, or you may incur Marked Cards penalties.

## J. Note-Taking

Note-taking in Official Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG tournaments is allowed in the following instances:
- You must keep a written record of both Duelists' Life Points for each Duel.
- Tracking of **mandatory** effect reminders.
- Tracking of turns and turn counters.
- Tracking of effects or actions necessary to maintain a legal Game State.
- Written records are the only acceptable form of note-taking. You may not use generic items such as dice, counters, or tokens as a form of note-taking, as these can be confused with other game elements.
- Notes must be taken quickly, so as not to disrupt the flow of the Duel. Slow Play or other penalties may apply if note-taking slows down the Duel.
- Notes are considered Public Knowledge and must be provided to the opponent or tournament official upon request.
- The "Notes" function of NEURON may not be used during a Match.

You may not use outside notes during a Match, which includes in between Games of a Match. You may consult a copy of your Deck List between Matches (not in between Games of a Match), to ensure you have restored your Main Deck, Side Deck, and Extra Deck to the proper condition.

## L. Public Knowledge

Duelists may not refuse to answer questions about information that is Public Knowledge. **Lying about or refusing to answer questions about information that is Public Knowledge may result in a Disqualification penalty.**

**Information printed on any card is always public knowledge. If a Duelist has a question regarding the printed information on a card that is not currently public knowledge, they should use the Offline Card Database search in NEURON to look up the information if they do not disrupt the pace of the game by doing so.**

**The following information is considered to be Public Knowledge, unless a card effect states otherwise.** Duelists must answer questions involving the following topics truthfully:
- The number of cards in a Duelist's hand
- The number of cards in a Duelist's Deck (this includes the Main Deck, Side Deck, and Extra Deck)
- The number and names of the cards in a Duelist's Graveyard and face-up Banished cards
- Both Duelist's current Life Point totals
- Any notes taken by either Duelist during a Duel
- Which cards were searched, Set, Summoned, destroyed, banished, activated, or Targeted by an effect during the current turn.

Examples of public knowledge:
- During Duelist A's turn, Duelist B asks Duelist A if he activated **Pot of Prosperity** during this turn. Duelist A must answer truthfully whether or not he activated **Pot of Prosperity** during the turn.
- During Duelist A's Main Phase 1, Duelist B activates **Eldlixir of White Destiny** and **Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine** to Special Summon 2 copies of **Eldlich the Golden Lord**. Duelist B already has a copy of Eldlich the Golden Lord on the field, Summoned by its own effect on a previous turn. Duelist A flip-summons Nobleman Eater Bug and activates its effect to destroy 2 monsters on the field. Duelist A asks Duelist B which of the three copies of **Eldlich the Golden Lord** were Summoned this turn. Since the second and third copies of **Eldlich the Golden Lord** were Summoned this turn, Duelist B must inform Duelist A which two were Summoned this turn.
- During Duelist A's Battle Phase, they declare an attack with **Kashtira Fenrir** and activate its effect to banish Duelist B's **Tearlaments Kitkallos**. During Main Phase 2, Duelist A asks Duelist B which card was banished by their card effect. Because the card was banished face-down during the same turn, Duelist B must answer.
- During Duelist A's Battle Phase, they declare an attack with **Kashtira Fenrir** and activate its effect to banish Duelist B's **Tearlaments Kitkallos**. During Main Phase 2, Duelist A asks Duelist B "What is the effect of **Tearlaments Kitkallos**?" Because the card was banished face-down during the same turn, Duelist B must answer. Duelists can use NEURON or call a judge, rather than picking up and reading the Set card. 

## M. Private Knowledge

Information that is Private Knowledge may not be revealed by a Duelist except by a card effect.
- Duelists may not answer questions about any Game State information that is considered Private Knowledge.
- **Intentionally giving false information about something that is considered Private Knowledge, or intentionally revealing information that is considered Private Knowledge, may result in a Disqualification penalty**.

The following information is considered to be Private Knowledge, unless a card effect states otherwise:
- All cards still in the Deck (this includes the Main Deck, Side Deck, and Extra Deck)
- All cards that are face-down, even if the cards have previously been face-up
- The cards in either Duelist's hand
- Which card(s) were searched, Set, Summoned, destroyed, banished, activated, or Targeted by
an effect during a previous turn.

Examples:
- A Duelist may not reveal that the has **Honest** in his hand unless he is legally activating the card.
- A Duelist may not reveal his Set **Mirror Force** unless he is legally activating the card.
- Duelist A cannot ask Duelist B "Do I know any of your cards?"
- On the previous turn, Duelist A activated **Ultimate Conductor Tyranno**'s effect to Set face-down
Duelist B's **Tearlaments Havnis**, **Kashtira Fenrir**, and **Abyss Dweller**. During the current turn, Duelist A cannot ask Duelist B to verify the identities of the monsters set by **Ultimate Conductor Tyranno**'s effect on the previous turn because their identities are now
considered to be Private Knowledge.
- A Duelist cannot ask for information about one of her opponent's face-down cards, even if that card was face-up on a previous turn.
- A Duelist may not reveal the Spell Card Set by the effect of **Alchemic Magician** after the end of the turn in which the effect was used.
- A Duelist may not reveal the Fusion Material added to the hand by the effect of **Fusion Conscription** after the end of the turn in which the effect was used.
- A Duelist may not ask his opponent to indicate the Spell/Trap Card Set with the effect of **Number 100: Numeron Dragon** after the end of the turn in which the
effect was used.

## N. Card/Hand/Deck Verification

With the exception of cards selected by a search effect, you may not search or verify any of your opponent's Private Knowledge locations, such as hand, Deck contents, or face-down cards, unless you are otherwise directed to do so by a card effect. Examples:
- A Duelist activates the effect of **Mystic Tomato**. Upon searching his Deck, he realizes that he does not have a legal card to Special Summon. His opponent does not get to search the Main Deck to verify.
- Verification directed by card effect: Duelist A activates the search effect of **Salamangreat Balelynx**, searches her Deck for **Salamangreat Sanctuary**, then shows it to her opponent before adding it to her hand.

You may not ask a judge to search or verify your opponent's hand, Deck contents, or face-down cards unless there is supportable evidence that your opponent may be cheating or that there may be a valid Deck-related issue.

- If you believe there is supportable evidence, stop playing and call for a judge.
    - Duelists should not perform the search or verification themselves.
- Explain the situation to the judge, who may ask additional questions.
- The judge will determine whether they should search or verify your opponent's hand, Deck, or face-down cards.
    - The judge must not reveal information considered Private Knowledge to either Duelist.

**Not appropriate for a judge for verify:**
- Duelist A activates **Mind Crush** and declares **Effect Veiler**. Duelist B says she does not have **Effect Veiler** in her hand. Duelist A does not get to see Duelist B's hand to verify. Duelist A cannot call a judge to verify Duelist B's hand unless there is supportable evidence that your opponent may be cheating or that there may be a valid Deck-related issue.
- During Game 1 of a Match, Duelist A Special Summons **Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju** to Duelist B's side of the field. Even though Gadarla is often used as a Side Deck card instead of a Main Deck card, Duelist B cannot call a judge to check Duelist A's Deck.

**Appropriate for a judge to verify:**
- Both Duelists are playing with the same color and type of sleeves. Duelist A notices that his total Deck count is short one card, while Duelist B's total Deck count is over by one card. A judge should be contacted to help resolve the situation - Duelists should not look through each other's Deck.
- During Game 1, Duelist A plays a Super Rare version of a Limited Spell Card. During Game 2, Duelist A plays a common version of the same Limited Spell card. His opponent notices that there appears to be two copies of a Limited card in Duelist A's Deck. It is appropriate to call a judge to examine the Deck.
- Duelist A activates **The Forceful Checkpoint**, and sees only **Gemini Elf**, **Goblin Attack Force**, **Big Shield Gardna**, and **Skill Drain** in Duelist B's hand. Duelist A chooses **Goblin Attack Force**; Duelist B discards it and ends his Battle Phase. During Main Phase 2, Duelist B sets 2 cards in his Spell/Trap Zone then ends his turn. Since Duelist A has seen that there was only one Trap card in Duelist B's hand, it is appropriate to call a judge to investigate.
- Duelist A activates **Pot of Duality** and adds a revealed **Effect Veiler** to her hand. The game continues for several turns, and Duelist A does not use **Effect Veiler**. Duelist B activates **Mind Crush** and declares **Effect Veiler**. Duelist A states there is no **Effect Veiler** in her hand. Duelist B knows that **Effect Veiler** was added to Duelist A's hand and knows it has not been played. It is acceptable to call a judge to investigate.

## O. Handling Card Loops

A "loop" is a series of actions that can be repeated. There are two kind of loops: Controlled Loops and Infinite Loops.

### Controlled Loops

Controlled loops are loops where the actions are voluntary and a Duelist controls how many times the action will repeat. The Duelist is able to stop the loop at any time by performing a legal action that does not cause the next effect on the loop to activate.

In a Controlled Loop, the Duelist should proceed as follows:

1. Perform the loop once, to notify your opponent that you are in a loop.
2. Using a whole number (positive value), inform your opponent how many times you intend to repeat the loop.
    - If a die roll is involved, the net gain of which does not affect the loop continuing, then the number of times you can repeat the loop is 1. Roll the die once only, there is no need to keep rolling the die as the loop will not be repeated.
    - If the start point and end point of a turn will be the same, but the order of the cards played may change; perform the loop once, explain that no matter what order the actions are performed, the result will be the same, then inform your opponent how many times you intend to repeat the loop. There is no need to keep performing the actions.
3. If your opponent wishes to activate an effect, they may do so at any interval up to the whole number listed above, as long as they are legally able to activate an effect.
4. Game play will proceed until either the whole number listed above has been reached, a win condition has been met (Life Points reach 0, unable to draw from Deck when required to do so, etc.), or until the opponent chooses to respond.
5. The Duelists will not physically perform the actions to keep the loop going but simply resolve the effects accordingly.
6. If any effects have been activated by the opponent to interrupt the loop, the loop will stop at that interval.
7. If the Duelist controlling the loop chooses to continue with the loop after the opponent interrupted the loop, they should perform the loop once more, to ensure the loop can still be achieved, and follow these steps again.
    - After the stated number of iterations of the loop have been resolved without action from the opponent, the Duelist may not initiate the loop again that turn unless a tangible change to the game state has occurred, such as if the opponent has taken some action that has changed the number of cards on the field/in the hands.

Examples:
- Duelist A controls **Cannon Soldier**, **Quillbolt Hedgehog**, **Glow-Up Bulb**, and a face-up **Imperial Iron Wall**. Both Duelists have 8,000 Life Points each. Duelist A activates the effect of **Cannon Soldier**, Tributing **Quillbolt Hedgehog** to inflict 500 damage to their opponent. They then activate the effect of **Quillbolt Hedgehog** to Special Summon itself onto the field, in order to use it again as Tribute for the effect of **Cannon Soldier**. Duelist A states that they will repeat the loop sixteen times until Duelist B's Life Points are reduced to zero.\
\
Duelist A does not need to perform the loop again.\ Duelist B may choose any interval to activate an effect. 
- Duelist A controls **Cannon Soldier**, **Quillbolt Hedgehog**, **Glow-Up Bulb**, and a face-up **Imperial Iron Wall**. Both Duelists have 8,000 Life Points each. Duelist A activates the effect of **Cannon Soldier**, Tributing **Quillbolt Hedgehog** to inflict 500 damage to their opponent. They then activate the effect of **Quillbolt Hedgehog** to Special Summon itself onto the field, in order to use it again as Tribute for the effect of **Cannon Soldier**. Duelist A states that they will repeat the loop sixteen times until Duelist B's Life Points are reduced to zero.\
\
Duelist A does not need to perform the loop again. Duelist B states that when the effect of **Quillbolt Hedgehog** is activated on the 12th loop, they will chain by activating their set **Hope for Escape**.\
\
The loop stops once this chain has resolved. If Duelist A wishes to do the loop again, they must go through the steps at least once to show they can still perform the loop.
