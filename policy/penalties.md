# Penalties

Both Duelists are responsible for maintaining the Game State, by clearly communicating with each other.\
Both Duelists are required to divulge any and all information that may be required to maintain a legal Game State.
- Irreparable game states -> game loss (who is most at fault). Never restart duel or match, nor double game loss except as an upgrade
- Reparable game states -> rewind to illegal action, even if opponent may gain advante from information that was previously private knowledge.
    - A searches for deck, but no targets (forgot). Reparable, A warning
    - A forgets mandatory effects. Reparable, BOTH warning
    - Both forget to record a change in LP, noticed later. Correct LP, BOTH warning
- Accepted game states -> sometimes, the judge may make the determination that even though the Game State has been damaged, it has happened too far back to fully repair and does not create a significant advantage for the Duelist most at fault. The judge may then declare the Game State to be “Accepted,” meaning play will continue as is
    - Both misread card effect and noticed later. Accepted game state and BOTH warning
    - Neither kept track of LP on paper and disagreement about LP. Accepted game state and both warning
    - A forgets mandatory effects. Too far back to repair, accepted game state and BOTH warning

4 types of penalties:
- Warning: minor infraction and unintentional. Repeated warnings for the **same** infraction can be upgraded.
- Game loss: when game state irreparable, **unintentional**.
- Match loss: **unintentional**, only head judge may give match loss penalty, with the exception of tardiness.
- Disqualification: **intentional** cheating, ignorance of a rule does not necessarily prevent the person from being disqualified. Only head judge may disqualified.

Only the head judge of an event may upgrade or downgrade a penalty (only penalties, infractions should never be upgraded or downgraded).
- Upgrades should only be given to a person repeating the same infraction during the course of the same event. 
- A Head Judge may choose to be a bit more lenient in the upgrade process during a Tier 1 event, choosing not to upgrade the penalty after the second infraction. 
- A Head Judge should be consistent about upgrading penalties at Tier 2 events. 
- If an event extends across more than one day, all days should be considered the same event, and penalties should continue to be upgraded.

A Head Judge may downgrade a penalty under extreme circumstances but should adhere to official policy in order to remain impartial and consistent. 
- Downgrading a penalty can be appropriate if the infraction is incurred due to circumstances beyond the person's control. 
- Downgrading a penalty can be appropriate when the standard penalty will have no impact on the tournament. 
- A person's age or experience level is not usually sufficient reason to downgrade a penalty. It is appropriate to educate and reassure the person, but judges should not assume the habit of downgrading penalties for infractions committed by new Duelists or young people.

## Appropriate to upgrade

- A Duelist commits a Slow Play infraction at a Regional and is given a Warning. Later in the same event, the same Duelist commits another Slow Play infraction. The appropriate response is to upgrade from a Warning to a Game Loss.
- A Duelist is not keeping track of her Life Points on paper (Procedural Error - Minor) on Day 1 of a YCS and receives a Warning. On Day 2 of the YCS, she again does not keep track of her Life Points on paper. Day 2 is considered a continuation of Day 1, so the appropriate response is to upgrade from a Warning to a Game Loss.

## Not Appropriate to upgrade

- A Duelist shifts the positions of their cards on the field at a Regional (Procedural Error - Minor) and receives a Warning. Later in the same tournament, they set a Spell or Trap card then attempt to take back the move (Procedural Error - Minor). Although both infractions are Procedural Error - Minor, they are not the same error. It is not appropriate to upgrade the penalty for the second Procedural Error.

## Appropriate to downgrade

- A Duelist leaves the venue to buy food, after being told by the TO that the next round will not start for another 20 minutes. The TO does not inform the Head Judge, who starts the next round. When the Duelist returns, he finds that he is more than 3 minutes late and would receive a Game Loss. The Head Judge investigates, determines that the TO did provide inaccurate information, and the Duelist had no way of knowing that the round was about to start. It is appropriate to remove the infraction.
- A Duelist in the final round of Swiss at a YCS loses the match, which ends his chance to move on to Single Elimination. The Duelist tears the match slip and refuses to sign it because he is so upset with the loss. Giving a Game Loss for this Unsporting Conduct - Major infraction will have no impact on the tournament, since there will not be a subsequent Match. It is appropriate to downgrade the penalty to de-escalate the situation, explaining to the Duelist that the penalty is being downgraded.

## Not appropriate to downgrade
- A young Duelist attends a Regional Qualifier for the first time, with a Deck sleeved in two different kinds of sleeves. A Deck check determines that Marked Cards - Major is the appropriate penalty. While the Duelist is new and did not understand why she cannot use 2 different kinds of sleeves, the age and skill level of the Duelist does not mean the penalty should be downgraded. The Duelist should be educated and reassured.

# Infractions

"Infractions" are errors in gameplay and/or violations of policy. Most infractions are considered to be unintentional errors, rather than deliberate actions. 
- If a person commits an infraction, a judge must apply the appropriate penalty. 
- Because there are degrees of infractions with different levels of impact on the event, there are corresponding degrees of severity for penalties. 
- The different categories of infractions can have different penalties administered, depending on the severity of the infraction.

Severity:

</table>

Types of infractions:
- **PE: Procedural Error**\
**Minor, Major and Strict**, general play errors.
- **T: Tardiness**\
**Major and Strict**, which indicate the severity of the infraction. Tardiness penalties should never be upgraded after repeat infractions. Since Tardiness penalties are never upgraded, Tardiness penalties are not required to be entered into the KONAMI Tournament Software (KTS) or the KONAMI Card Game Network (KCGN).
- **DE: Deck and Deck List Errors**\
**Major and Strict**, registering incorrect contents on a Deck List or playing
with an illegal Deck. If an error that would result in an illegal Deck or Deck List is caught prior to the start of the first round, it is acceptable (at the Head Judge's discretion) to correct the Duelist's Deck List without applying a penalty.
- **DC: Drawing Extra Cards**\
**Minor and Major**
